# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Validation feature aims to provide a comprehensive validation system that ensures code meets business rules, security standards, and documentation requirements before being published or deployed. This feature will help developers identify and fix potential issues early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and poor code quality in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Business Rules Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that my code adheres to business rules and logic, so that I can ensure the application behaves as expected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validation is initiated THEN the system SHALL check all business rule implementations against their specifications
2. WHEN business rule violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with references to the violated rules
3. WHEN custom business rules are defined in configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate code against these custom rules
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a report categorizing business rule compliance status

### Requirement 2: Security Validation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to validate that my code follows security best practices, so that I can prevent vulnerabilities before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan for common security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the vulnerability and remediation steps
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check for insecure dependencies and libraries
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify proper implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check for proper input validation and output encoding
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL assign a security risk score to the codebase

### Requirement 3: Documentation Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure my code is properly documented, so that other team members can understand and maintain it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is initiated THEN the system SHALL verify that all public methods and classes have appropriate documentation
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check that documentation follows the project's documentation standards
3. WHEN documentation is missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for improvement
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a documentation coverage report

### Requirement 4: Code Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the overall quality of my code, so that I can maintain high standards and improve maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is initiated THEN the system SHALL check code against style guidelines and best practices
2. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL identify code smells and anti-patterns
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate code complexity metrics
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check for code duplication
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for code improvement

### Requirement 5: Compliance Validation

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ensure that code meets regulatory requirements, so that the organization avoids legal and financial penalties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is initiated THEN the system SHALL check code against configured compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
2. WHEN compliance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the violation and remediation steps
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify that data handling practices meet privacy requirements
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a compliance report suitable for audit purposes

### Requirement 6: Integration with Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want the validation system to integrate with our existing development workflow, so that validation becomes a seamless part of our process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed to version control THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger validation
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL perform validation and report results
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL block merging until issues are resolved or explicitly overridden
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members of the results
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines

### Requirement 7: Customization and Configuration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to customize validation rules based on project requirements, so that validation is relevant and appropriate for each project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new project is set up THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of validation rules through configuration files
2. WHEN validation rules need to be modified THEN the system SHALL provide an interface for rule customization
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL respect project-specific rule exceptions and thresholds
4. WHEN new validation rules are created THEN the system SHALL provide a way to test and verify these rules
