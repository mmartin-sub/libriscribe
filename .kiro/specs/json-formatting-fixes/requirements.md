# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JSON Formatting Fixes feature addresses the issue where LibriScribe generates JSON files containing Unicode escape sequences (like `\u2014` and `\u2019`) instead of readable Unicode characters. This feature ensures that generated JSON files preserve Unicode characters in their readable form by using `ensure_ascii=False` in all JSON serialization calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Preserve Unicode Characters in JSON Output

**User Story:** As a developer working with LibriScribe-generated JSON files, I want JSON output to preserve Unicode characters in readable form instead of escape sequences, so that the files are more readable and maintain proper character representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON files are generated THEN the system SHALL use `ensure_ascii=False` parameter in all `json.dump()` and `json.dumps()` calls
2. WHEN Unicode characters are present THEN the system SHALL preserve them as readable Unicode characters rather than escape sequences
3. WHEN JSON serialization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper UTF-8 encoding
4. WHEN existing JSON reading functionality is used THEN it SHALL continue to work with both escaped and unescaped Unicode characters
5. WHEN JSON files are written THEN they SHALL be human-readable with proper Unicode character display

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive JSON Function Updates

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want all JSON serialization functions in the codebase to use consistent Unicode handling, so that all generated JSON files have the same readable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `write_json_file()` function is called THEN it SHALL use `ensure_ascii=False` parameter
2. WHEN any direct `json.dump()` calls exist THEN they SHALL be updated to include `ensure_ascii=False`
3. WHEN any direct `json.dumps()` calls exist THEN they SHALL be updated to include `ensure_ascii=False`
4. WHEN JSON serialization occurs in agent outputs THEN it SHALL use the updated formatting
5. WHEN project data is saved THEN it SHALL use the improved Unicode handling

### Requirement 3: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that JSON formatting changes work correctly and don't break existing functionality, so that the system remains stable after the updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON formatting is modified THEN the system SHALL include tests verifying Unicode characters are preserved
2. WHEN existing JSON files are read THEN the system SHALL handle both old (escaped) and new (unescaped) formats
3. WHEN JSON files are generated THEN they SHALL be valid JSON that can be parsed correctly
4. WHEN round-trip testing is performed THEN data SHALL be preserved correctly through write/read cycles
5. WHEN integration tests are run THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
