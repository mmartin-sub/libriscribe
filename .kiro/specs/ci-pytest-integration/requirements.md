# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate automated pytest execution into the GitHub CI/CD pipeline, specifically triggered during pull request events. The integration will use a fast pytest configuration that runs tests efficiently with early failure detection and concise output formatting. This ensures code quality is maintained through automated testing before code is merged into the main branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests to run on every pull request, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the CI system SHALL automatically trigger pytest execution
2. WHEN a pull request is updated with new commits THEN the CI system SHALL re-run the pytest suite
3. WHEN pytest execution completes THEN the CI system SHALL report the test results as a status check on the pull request

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast test execution with early failure detection, so that I can get quick feedback on test failures without waiting for the entire suite to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pytest is executed in CI THEN the system SHALL use the `-x` flag to stop on first failure
2. WHEN pytest is executed in CI THEN the system SHALL use the `--tb=short` flag for concise traceback output
3. WHEN pytest is executed in CI THEN the system SHALL target the `tests/` directory specifically
4. WHEN pytest encounters a test failure THEN the system SHALL immediately stop execution and report the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI configuration to be maintainable and follow best practices, so that the testing pipeline is reliable and easy to update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI workflow is defined THEN it SHALL use GitHub Actions as the CI platform
2. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN it SHALL set up the appropriate Python environment for the project
3. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN it SHALL install project dependencies before running tests
4. WHEN the CI workflow configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing project structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want clear test results and status indicators, so that I can quickly understand the health of a pull request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests pass THEN the CI system SHALL mark the pull request status check as successful
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI system SHALL mark the pull request status check as failed with error details
3. WHEN the CI workflow is running THEN the system SHALL show a pending status on the pull request
4. WHEN viewing the pull request THEN developers SHALL be able to access detailed test logs and results
