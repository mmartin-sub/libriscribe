# Design Document

## Overview

The CI pytest integration will be implemented using GitHub Actions to automatically run pytest on pull requests. The solution will use a simple workflow configuration that sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs tests with optimized flags for fast feedback.

## Architecture

The integration follows a standard GitHub Actions workflow pattern:

```
Pull Request Event → GitHub Actions Trigger → Environment Setup → Dependency Installation → Test Execution → Status Report
```

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- **Triggers**: Pull request events (opened, synchronize, reopened)
- **Environment**: Ubuntu latest with Python setup
- **Dependencies**: Project requirements installed via pip/uv

### Test Configuration
- **Command**: `pytest tests/ -x --tb=short`
- **Flags**:
  - `-x`: Stop on first failure for fast feedback
  - `--tb=short`: Concise traceback output
  - `tests/`: Target specific test directory

### Status Reporting
- **Success**: Green check mark on PR with "Tests passed" message
- **Failure**: Red X on PR with failure details and logs
- **Pending**: Yellow circle while tests are running

## Data Models

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e .
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/ -x --tb=short
```

## Error Handling

### Test Failures
- Immediate termination on first failure (`-x` flag)
- Concise error reporting (`--tb=short` flag)
- Clear status check failure with accessible logs

### CI Environment Issues
- Dependency installation failures will fail the workflow
- Python setup issues will be caught by GitHub Actions
- Workflow syntax errors will be reported in Actions tab

### Edge Cases
- Empty test directory: pytest will report no tests collected
- Missing dependencies: pip install will fail with clear error
- Test discovery issues: pytest will report collection errors

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow Testing
- Test the workflow with a simple passing test
- Test the workflow with a failing test to verify `-x` behavior
- Test the workflow with dependency issues
- Verify status checks appear correctly on pull requests

### Integration Testing
- Create test pull requests to verify trigger behavior
- Verify workflow runs on PR updates
- Test that status checks block merge when configured

### Validation
- Ensure workflow follows GitHub Actions best practices
- Verify Python environment setup is appropriate for project
- Confirm test command matches project testing conventions
