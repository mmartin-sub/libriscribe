# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create GitHub Actions workflow directory structure
  - Create `.github/workflows/` directory if it doesn't exist
  - Set up proper directory permissions and structure
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [x] 2. Implement GitHub Actions workflow configuration
  - Create `test.yml` workflow file with pull request triggers
  - Configure Ubuntu environment with Python setup
  - Define workflow steps for checkout, Python setup, dependency installation, and test execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Configure pytest execution with optimized flags
  - Set pytest command to target `tests/` directory specifically
  - Add `-x` flag for early failure detection
  - Add `--tb=short` flag for concise traceback output
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Set up dependency installation step
  - Configure pip upgrade and project installation
  - Handle project dependencies installation
  - Ensure compatibility with existing project structure
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Implement status reporting and error handling
  - Configure workflow to report success/failure status to pull requests
  - Ensure clear error messages are displayed on failure
  - Set up proper workflow status indicators
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Test workflow functionality
  - Create a test pull request to verify workflow triggers
  - Test with passing tests to verify success status
  - Test with failing tests to verify failure detection and early termination
  - Verify status checks appear correctly on pull requests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
