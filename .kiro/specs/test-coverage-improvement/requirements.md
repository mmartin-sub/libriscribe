# Requirements for Test Coverage Improvement

## 1. Goal

The goal of this task is to improve the test coverage of the project to at least 80%.

## 2. Scope

The following files have been identified as having low test coverage and should be prioritized:

- `src/libriscribe2/agents/title_generator.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/process.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/utils/markdown_utils.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/utils/performance_improvements.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/utils/type_improvements.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/validation/utils/__init__.py` (0%)
- `src/libriscribe2/agents/researcher.py` (19%)
- `src/libriscribe2/validation/config.py` (20%)
- `src/libriscribe2/agent_frameworks/autogen/service.py` (23%)
- `src/libriscribe2/agents/fact_checker.py` (23%)
- `src/libriscribe2/agents/style_editor.py` (23%)
- `src/libriscribe2/validation/ai_mock.py` (24%)
- `src/libriscribe2/agents/plagiarism_checker.py` (26%)
- `src/libriscribe2/validation/validation_engine.py` (29%)
- `src/libriscribe2/cli.py` (32%)

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- The test coverage for each of the files listed above should be at least 80%.
- The total test coverage of the project should be at least 80%.
- All new tests should be written using the `pytest` framework.
- All new tests should follow the existing testing conventions of the project.
