# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Install library type stubs for external dependencies
  - Install type stubs for mistletoe library to resolve import-untyped errors
  - Update pyproject.toml with new type stub dependencies
  - Verify mypy can find and use the installed stubs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Add type annotations to base.py untyped functions
  - Add explicit type annotations to functions at lines 110-111 in base.py
  - Ensure all function parameters have proper type hints
  - Add appropriate return type annotations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Add type annotations to performance_improvements.py untyped functions
  - Add type annotations to function at line 57 in performance_improvements.py
  - Add type annotations to functions at lines 102-103 in performance_improvements.py
  - Add type annotations to function at line 289 in performance_improvements.py
  - Ensure all parameters and return types are properly annotated
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Add necessary typing imports to all modified files
  - Import required typing constructs (Any, Optional, Union, etc.) where needed
  - Organize imports according to PEP 8 standards
  - Remove any unused imports after type annotation additions
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 5. Validate mypy strict compliance for all fixed files
  - Run mypy strict mode on each modified file individually
  - Verify no new type errors are introduced
  - Confirm all original annotation-unchecked and import-untyped errors are resolved
  - _Requirements: 10.3, 10.4_

- [x] 6. Run comprehensive mypy validation on entire codebase
  - Execute full mypy strict check on the complete project
  - Document error count reduction from baseline
  - Verify no runtime functionality is affected by type annotation changes
  - _Requirements: 10.4, 10.5_

- [-] 7. Fix lambda function type signature issues in execute_parallel_tasks
  - Fix type signature mismatch in AsyncTaskManager.execute_parallel_tasks method
  - Update method signature to accept proper callable types with captured variables
  - Fix lambda function usage in performance_improvements_usage.py lines 145 and 494
  - Ensure generic type parameters work correctly with lambda functions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 7.1, 7.2_
