# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MyPy Type Fixes feature addresses the comprehensive type checking issues currently present in the LibriScribe codebase. The system has numerous mypy errors including missing type annotations, incompatible types, missing library stubs, and function signature issues that need to be systematically resolved to maintain code quality and enable proper static type checking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Library Stub Installation and Import Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required library type stubs installed and proper imports added, so that mypy can properly type-check external library usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mypy encounters missing library stubs THEN the system SHALL install the required type stubs packages (types-PyYAML, types-requests)
2. WHEN missing imports are detected THEN the system SHALL add the required imports from typing module (Optional, Dict, List, etc.)
3. WHEN library imports are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly organized and follow import conventions
4. WHEN type stubs are installed THEN the system SHALL update pyproject.toml dependencies appropriately
5. WHEN imports are complete THEN the system SHALL verify no import-related mypy errors remain

### Requirement 2: Function Type Annotation Completion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all functions to have proper type annotations, so that the codebase maintains type safety and clarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions lack return type annotations THEN the system SHALL add appropriate return type hints
2. WHEN functions lack parameter type annotations THEN the system SHALL add proper parameter type hints
3. WHEN functions return None THEN the system SHALL explicitly annotate with `-> None`
4. WHEN functions have complex return types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Union, Optional, or generic types
5. WHEN type annotations are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they accurately reflect the actual function behavior

### Requirement 3: Variable Type Annotation Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all variables that require explicit type annotations to be properly typed, so that mypy can perform accurate type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables need explicit type annotations THEN the system SHALL add appropriate type hints
2. WHEN container variables are untyped THEN the system SHALL add generic type annotations (list[str], dict[str, Any], etc.)
3. WHEN class attributes need typing THEN the system SHALL add proper type annotations
4. WHEN module-level variables need typing THEN the system SHALL add appropriate type hints
5. WHEN type annotations are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they match the actual usage patterns

### Requirement 4: Incompatible Type Assignment Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type assignment incompatibilities resolved, so that the code maintains type safety without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incompatible assignments are detected THEN the system SHALL fix the type mismatches appropriately
2. WHEN None assignments conflict with non-optional types THEN the system SHALL either make types optional or handle None cases
3. WHEN union type issues occur THEN the system SHALL add proper type guards or adjust type annotations
4. WHEN default parameter types conflict THEN the system SHALL fix parameter type annotations or default values
5. WHEN type fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure no runtime behavior changes occur

### Requirement 5: Optional Type and None Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Optional type usage and None handling, so that the codebase correctly represents nullable values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameters have None defaults THEN the system SHALL make them Optional or use Union[T, None]
2. WHEN variables can be None THEN the system SHALL use Optional type annotations
3. WHEN None checks are needed THEN the system SHALL add appropriate type guards
4. WHEN Optional types are used THEN the system SHALL ensure proper None handling in the code
5. WHEN implicit Optional is detected THEN the system SHALL make it explicit per PEP 484

### Requirement 6: Class Attribute and Method Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all class-related type issues resolved, so that object-oriented code maintains proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN class attributes are missing THEN the system SHALL add them with proper type annotations
2. WHEN method signatures are incompatible THEN the system SHALL fix parameter and return types
3. WHEN inheritance issues occur THEN the system SHALL ensure proper method signature compatibility
4. WHEN class initialization issues exist THEN the system SHALL fix constructor parameter types
5. WHEN class fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain proper object-oriented design principles

### Requirement 7: Generic Type and Collection Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper generic type usage for collections and complex types, so that type checking provides accurate information about container contents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generic collections are used THEN the system SHALL add proper type parameters (list[T], dict[K, V])
2. WHEN complex generic types are needed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate generic type annotations
3. WHEN type parameters are unclear THEN the system SHALL infer appropriate types from usage
4. WHEN generic fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety is maintained
5. WHEN collection types are updated THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with existing code

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Exception Type Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper exception handling with correct type annotations, so that error handling code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exception handling lacks type information THEN the system SHALL add proper exception type annotations
2. WHEN custom exceptions are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they have proper type definitions
3. WHEN error return types are used THEN the system SHALL add appropriate Union types with error types
4. WHEN exception fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain existing error handling behavior
5. WHEN error types are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with calling code

### Requirement 9: Development Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the type fixes to integrate properly with the hatch and uv development environment, so that the fixes work seamlessly with the existing toolchain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL add them to pyproject.toml
2. WHEN type stubs are installed THEN the system SHALL use uv/hatch package management
3. WHEN development dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL categorize them appropriately in pyproject.toml
4. WHEN environment setup is needed THEN the system SHALL work within `hatch shell` environment
5. WHEN toolchain integration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify mypy runs successfully in the development environment

### Requirement 10: Incremental Fix Application and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type fixes applied incrementally with validation at each step, so that the codebase remains functional throughout the fixing process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL process files in logical dependency order
2. WHEN each file is fixed THEN the system SHALL validate the fixes don't break existing functionality
3. WHEN mypy errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL verify no new errors are introduced
4. WHEN fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL run full mypy validation to confirm all issues are resolved
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on remaining issues
