# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the timestamp utilities module to ensure full compliance with ISO 8601-2:2019 UTC standards and proper error handling. The current implementation has several failing tests that need to be resolved to maintain data consistency and reliability across the LibriScribe2 application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want timestamp parsing functions to properly validate input formats, so that invalid timestamps are rejected with clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid ISO 8601 timestamp string is passed to `parse_iso8601_timestamp()` THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError with a descriptive message
2. WHEN a None value is passed to `parse_iso8601_timestamp()` THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
3. WHEN an empty string is passed to `parse_iso8601_timestamp()` THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
4. WHEN a timestamp without timezone indicator is passed THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
5. WHEN a timestamp with incorrect format is passed THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want timestamp validation functions to correctly identify invalid formats, so that I can handle invalid data appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `is_valid_iso8601_timestamp()` receives an invalid timestamp string THEN the system SHALL return False
2. WHEN `is_valid_iso8601_timestamp()` receives None THEN the system SHALL return False
3. WHEN `is_valid_iso8601_timestamp()` receives an empty string THEN the system SHALL return False
4. WHEN `is_valid_iso8601_timestamp()` receives a timestamp without 'Z' suffix THEN the system SHALL return False
5. WHEN `is_valid_iso8601_timestamp()` receives a valid ISO 8601-2:2019 UTC timestamp THEN the system SHALL return True

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all generated timestamps to have consistent microsecond precision, so that timestamp comparisons and sorting work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `get_iso8601_utc_timestamp()` is called THEN the system SHALL return a timestamp with exactly 6 microsecond digits
2. WHEN a datetime with zero microseconds is converted THEN the system SHALL include ".000000" in the output
3. WHEN timestamps are generated at midnight THEN the system SHALL include full microsecond precision
4. WHEN timestamps are generated at year boundaries THEN the system SHALL include full microsecond precision
5. WHEN converting different precision timestamps THEN the system SHALL normalize to 6-digit microsecond format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want timestamp conversion functions to handle type validation properly, so that unsupported input types are rejected with clear errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `convert_to_iso8601_utc()` receives an unsupported type THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
2. WHEN boolean values are passed to conversion functions THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
3. WHEN list or dict objects are passed to conversion functions THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
4. WHEN custom objects are passed to conversion functions THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError
5. WHEN supported types (datetime, int, float, str) are passed THEN the system SHALL convert successfully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want timestamp formatting to be consistent with the ISO 8601-2:2019 standard, so that all timestamps follow the same format specification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timestamps are converted from different input formats THEN the system SHALL normalize microsecond precision to 6 digits
2. WHEN parsing timestamps with varying microsecond precision THEN the system SHALL handle 0-6 digit precision correctly
3. WHEN converting timestamps without microseconds THEN the system SHALL add ".000000" to maintain format consistency
4. WHEN generating timestamps THEN the system SHALL always use UTC timezone with 'Z' suffix
5. WHEN formatting timestamps for different use cases THEN the system SHALL maintain precision requirements per the timestamp standards document
