Caro arrives first, clutching the sketchbook she has not opened in fifteen years; Isa arrives barefoot, her shoes lost somewhere between Siberia and immigration. Over the next eight hours—while the infant’s lungs struggle and Harper sleeps off anesthesia—they speak in fragments, then paragraphs, then the full, unbearable truth: the fellowship, the unsent letters, the painting Caro abandoned, the babies Isa saved but could not carry. Their husbands arrive—Isa’s gentle Frenchman with espresso and apologies, Caro’s Korean-American spouse with divorce papers folded small—and the children, now grown, watch from the hallway. At 5:03 a.m., the baby stabilizes. Isa and Caro step outside into the first pale light of Seoul’s winter dawn, stand at the exact latitude where forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes the choice to speak the next sentence. The book ends with Caro opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Isa handing her a pen, and the two of them beginning—at last—to draw the same line.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: For emotional beats: isolation → shock → fragile connection → painful honesty → betrayal → hope → quiet determination.
