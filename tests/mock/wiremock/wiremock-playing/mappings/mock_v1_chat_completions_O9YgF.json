Caro arrives first, clutching the sketchbook she has not opened in fifteen years; Isa arrives barefoot, her shoes lost somewhere between Siberia and immigration. Over the next eight hours—while the infant’s lungs struggle and Harper sleeps off anesthesia—they speak in fragments, then paragraphs, then the full, unbearable truth: the fellowship, the unsent letters, the painting Caro abandoned, the babies Isa saved but could not carry. Their husbands arrive—Isa’s gentle Frenchman with espresso and apologies, Caro’s Korean-American spouse with divorce papers folded small—and the children, now grown, watch from the hallway. At 5:03 a.m., the baby stabilizes. Isa and Caro step outside into the first pale light of Seoul’s winter dawn, stand at the exact latitude where forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes the choice to speak the next sentence. The book ends with Caro opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Isa handing her a pen, and the two of them beginning—at last—to draw the same line.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Etienne (Isa's French husband) arrives with espresso and quiet apologies for his absence during Isa's journey, while David (Caro's Korean-American husband) appears with divorce papers folded in his pocket, his silence speaking volumes as both men observe the sisters' fragile truce.\\n- Characters: Isa, Caro, Etienne, David\\n- Setting: NICU waiting room; 4:50 a.m., the room now has a few more family members awake.\\n- Goal: Introduce the husbands' roles and unresolved tensions, contrasting Etienne's remorse with David's quiet devastation, emphasizing the collateral damage of the sisters' feud.\\n- Emotional Beat: Complicated grief and the weight of secondary betrayals.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling.
