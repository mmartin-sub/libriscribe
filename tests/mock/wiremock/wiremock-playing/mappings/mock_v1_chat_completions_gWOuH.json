The doctors need next-of-kin consent for an emergency C-section. Isa is unreachable, somewhere on a train between Berlin and the Russian frontier because she still refuses to board a plane. Caro, barefoot in her kitchen, promises to come, then realizes she has no idea how to tell Isa that Harper is even in Korea. The chapter alternates between Caro’s frantic preparations—grabbing her long-abandoned sketchbook as if it were a passport—and flashbacks to the night fifteen years earlier when Isa accepted the Strasbourg fellowship, the night their communal life in Ohio splintered. In the final pages, Caro boards the overnight ferry to Fukuoka, carrying nothing but the sketchbook, a prepaid phone, and the certainty that every rupture is her fault.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: At 4:12 a.m. in her Seoul apartment, Caro jolts awake to a call from Samsung Medical Center informing her that her niece Harper is in sudden labor at 33 weeks and requires immediate next-of-kin consent for an emergency C-section.
