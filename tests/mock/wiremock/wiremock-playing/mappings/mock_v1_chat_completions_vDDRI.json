Each woman carries the accumulated weight of fifteen years of silence, regret, and unspoken betrayal. Their parallel journeys—Isa on the Trans-Siberian and Caro on ferries and budget flights—force them to confront the men they left behind, the art they abandoned, and the moment their shared story cracked. When they finally meet in a glass-walled waiting room, the question is no longer who was right or wrong, but whether the flickering life inside an incubator will survive long enough for the first honest sentence in fifteen years to matter.\\nTold in shifting perspectives—Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children—the novel braids past and present, Ohio and East Asia, painting and medicine, until the latitude at which forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes a choice is reached in the fluorescent hush of a Seoul hospital at 3:00 a.m.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: The sisters meet at 2:47 a.m. in the NICU waiting room, separated by a wall of glass and the soft beeping of monitors. Caro arrives first, clutching the sketchbook she has not opened in fifteen years; Isa arrives barefoot, her shoes lost somewhere between Siberia and immigration. Over the next eight hours—while the infant’s lungs struggle and Harper sleeps off anesthesia—they speak in fragments, then paragraphs, then the full, unbearable truth: the fellowship, the unsent letters, the painting Caro abandoned, the babies Isa saved but could not carry. Their husbands arrive—Isa’s gentle Frenchman with espresso and apologies, Caro’s Korean-American spouse with divorce papers folded small—and the children, now grown, watch from the hallway. At 5:03 a.m., the baby stabilizes. Isa and Caro step outside into the first pale light of Seoul’s winter dawn, stand at the exact latitude where forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes the choice to speak the next sentence. The book ends with Caro opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Isa handing her a pen, and the two of them beginning—at last—to draw the same line.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 7 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 7 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}]}",
