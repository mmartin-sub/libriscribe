The message is garbled—something about Harper, something about bleeding. She spends the next six hours in the dining car, writing letters to Caro she will probably never send, each one beginning with “I should have told you sooner.” The chapter toggles between Isa’s present-tense panic—bribing a conductor for Wi-Fi, learning Harper is in Seoul, realizing Caro is already on the move—and the past: the Ohio farmhouse where she and Caro raised their children on apples and thrift-store dresses, the night Caro’s husband found the unsent acceptance letter to the Strasbourg fellowship hidden in Isa’s sketchbook. Somewhere past the Urals, Isa decides to fly the final leg from Vladivostok to Incheon, breaking her own rule against giving up too fast. She carries an envelope of fifteen years of unsent letters, now heavier than any suitcase.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Flashback to the Ohio farmhouse, where Isa and Caro paint autumn leaves with their children, their bond unbroken, unaware of the fracture looming in their shared future.\\n- Characters: Isa, Caro, Harper (child), Elena (Isa’s son)\\n- Setting: A sunlit kitchen in rural Ohio, 2008.\\n- Goal: Highlight the sisters’ former intimacy and the innocence before betrayal.\\n- Emotional Beat: Nostalgia\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling.
