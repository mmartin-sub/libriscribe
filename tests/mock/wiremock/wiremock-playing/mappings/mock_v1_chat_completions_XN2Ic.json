Caro arrives first, clutching the sketchbook she has not opened in fifteen years; Isa arrives barefoot, her shoes lost somewhere between Siberia and immigration. Over the next eight hours—while the infant’s lungs struggle and Harper sleeps off anesthesia—they speak in fragments, then paragraphs, then the full, unbearable truth: the fellowship, the unsent letters, the painting Caro abandoned, the babies Isa saved but could not carry. Their husbands arrive—Isa’s gentle Frenchman with espresso and apologies, Caro’s Korean-American spouse with divorce papers folded small—and the children, now grown, watch from the hallway. At 5:03 a.m., the baby stabilizes. Isa and Caro step outside into the first pale light of Seoul’s winter dawn, stand at the exact latitude where forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes the choice to speak the next sentence. The book ends with Caro opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Isa handing her a pen, and the two of them beginning—at last—to draw the same line.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Sitting stiffly three chairs apart, the sisters exchange fragmented, hesitant words about the flight and Harper's condition, their conversation punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of the infant's monitor behind the glass.\\n- Characters: Isa, Caro\\n- Setting: NICU waiting room; 3:45 a.m., the room is nearly empty except for a sleeping elderly couple in the corner.\\n- Goal: Break the initial ice with superficial dialogue, revealing the immense effort required for even basic communication and highlighting the pervasive presence of the infant's struggle.\\n- Emotional Beat: Fragile, painful reconnection.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling. Create an immersive experience that brings the scene to life.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The content should be written entirely in US-English.\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Begin the scene with the title: ## Scene 3: Sitting stiffly three chairs apart, the sisters exchange fragmented, hesitant words about the flight and Harper's condition, their conversation punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of the infant's monitor behind the glass.
