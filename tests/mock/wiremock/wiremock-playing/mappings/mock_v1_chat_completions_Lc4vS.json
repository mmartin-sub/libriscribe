Each woman carries the accumulated weight of fifteen years of silence, regret, and unspoken betrayal. Their parallel journeys—Isa on the Trans-Siberian and Caro on ferries and budget flights—force them to confront the men they left behind, the art they abandoned, and the moment their shared story cracked. When they finally meet in a glass-walled waiting room, the question is no longer who was right or wrong, but whether the flickering life inside an incubator will survive long enough for the first honest sentence in fifteen years to matter.\\nTold in shifting perspectives—Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children—the novel braids past and present, Ohio and East Asia, painting and medicine, until the latitude at which forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes a choice is reached in the fluorescent hush of a Seoul hospital at 3:00 a.m.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: Isa wakes in the swaying berth of the Berlin-Moscow express to a voicemail from a Seoul number she does not recognize. The message is garbled—something about Harper, something about bleeding. She spends the next six hours in the dining car, writing letters to Caro she will probably never send, each one beginning with “I should have told you sooner.” The chapter toggles between Isa’s present-tense panic—bribing a conductor for Wi-Fi, learning Harper is in Seoul, realizing Caro is already on the move—and the past: the Ohio farmhouse where she and Caro raised their children on apples and thrift-store dresses, the night Caro’s husband found the unsent acceptance letter to the Strasbourg fellowship hidden in Isa’s sketchbook. Somewhere past the Urals, Isa decides to fly the final leg from Vladivostok to Incheon, breaking her own rule against giving up too fast. She carries an envelope of fifteen years of unsent letters, now heavier than any suitcase.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 7 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 7 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}]}",
