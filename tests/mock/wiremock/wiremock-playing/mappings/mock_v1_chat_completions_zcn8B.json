The doctors need next-of-kin consent for an emergency C-section. Isa is unreachable, somewhere on a train between Berlin and the Russian frontier because she still refuses to board a plane. Caro, barefoot in her kitchen, promises to come, then realizes she has no idea how to tell Isa that Harper is even in Korea. The chapter alternates between Caro’s frantic preparations—grabbing her long-abandoned sketchbook as if it were a passport—and flashbacks to the night fifteen years earlier when Isa accepted the Strasbourg fellowship, the night their communal life in Ohio splintered. In the final pages, Caro boards the overnight ferry to Fukuoka, carrying nothing but the sketchbook, a prepaid phone, and the certainty that every rupture is her fault.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Caro races through the deserted Beonyeongdo Ferry Terminal in Busan, boarding the overnight ferry to Fukuoka with only her sketchbook, a prepaid phone, and the suffocating conviction that every broken bond since Ohio stems from her own failures. She stares at the churning black water, knowing time is bleeding away for Harper’s baby.\\n- Characters: Caro, Ferry Crew Member (background)\\n- Setting: Rain-lashed Beonyeongdo Ferry Terminal at 3:47 a.m., neon lights reflecting on wet concrete\\n- Goal: Propel Caro into her physical journey while cementing her internal burden of guilt\\n- Emotional Beat: Hollow resolve and desperate urgency\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling.
