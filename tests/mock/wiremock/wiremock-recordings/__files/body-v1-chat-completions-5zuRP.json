The impact felt soft at first—just a shudder through the airframe, a whisper of something wrong. Then the helicopter twisted, metal screaming as the world flipped sideways.\n\nIsa’s headset tore off in the spin. The pregnant girl—Amira, sixteen years old and bleeding through her abaya—floated against her restraints, mouth open in a silent scream. The pilot’s hands were frantic on the cyclic stick, trying to coax life from dying hydraulics. Outside the windshield, pine trees spun in a dizzy carousel of green and brown.\n\n“Mayday mayday mayday—” The copilot’s voice cut to static as the radio antenna sheared away.\n\nThe Black Forest rushed up to meet them. Isa had time to think: *This is where fairy tales come to die.* Then impact—hard, harder than she’d imagined death would feel. Metal folding like paper. Fuel igniting in a whoosh of heat that peeled paint from the fuselage.\n\nShe came to hanging upside down in her harness.\n\nBlood ran into her eyes—warm, metallic. The world tilted at impossible angles through the cracked windshield. Amira was unconscious but breathing, each exhale fogging a small circle on the cracked plexiglass. Beyond the glass, smoke curled around tree trunks like incense.\n\nThe pilot groaned somewhere behind her. “Get out... fuel line...”\n\nIsa’s left shoulder was wrong—dislocated, maybe worse. She bit down on the scream as she released her harness, dropping to the ceiling with bone-jarring force. The helicopter groaned around her, settling deeper into the pine carpet that had broken their fall.\n\n“Amira.” She crawled across buckled metal, each movement sending fire through her collarbone. “Amira, wake up.”\n\nThe girl’s eyelids fluttered. “Cold,” she whispered in Arabic. “So cold.”\n\nSmoke thickened, black and chemical. Through the broken windshield, Isa could see flames licking up the side of the wreckage, orange tongues tasting the fuel that pooled beneath them. The smell of burning aviation fuel mixed with something worse—cooked flesh, maybe. Maybe her own.\n\nShe got Amira’s harness unbuckled, cradled the girl’s head as she lowered her to what had become their floor. The pregnancy was high-risk—pre-eclampsia, the doctors at the field hospital had said. Now she was bleeding again, dark stains spreading across pale fabric.\n\n“My baby,” Amira gasped. “Please—”\n\n“I’ve got you.” Isa’s voice sounded foreign, like someone else speaking through her mouth. “We’re getting out.”\n\nThe emergency exit was jammed, warped metal refusing to budge. Isa kicked at it with her good leg, felt the impact travel up through her teeth. On the third kick, it gave way with a shriek of tortured aluminum.\n\nFresh air rushed in—cold, pine-scented, laced with diesel smoke. Behind them, something popped. The fire found the fuel tank.\n\nIsa grabbed Amira under the arms and pulled. The girl weighed nothing—fever and blood loss had hollowed her out. They tumbled through the exit just as the helicopter coughed its first explosion, heat washing over them like a tide.\n\nThey rolled down a slope of pine needles and wet earth. The second explosion came when they were twenty feet away, close enough to feel the concussion in their bones but far enough that the shrapnel whistled overhead instead of through them.\n\nIsa came to rest against a fallen log, lungs burning with smoke and altitude. Amira lay beside her, eyes closed, one hand resting protectively on her swollen belly. Beyond the burning wreckage, the Black Forest stretched in all directions—dark, ancient, indifferent.\n\nHer phone buzzed.\n\nThe sound was wrong here, too modern for a place that had swallowed armies. She fumbled it from her pocket with shaking fingers, the screen cracked but still glowing. The caller ID showed nothing—just a string of zeros that hurt to look at.\n\nShe almost didn’t answer. Almost threw the phone into the flames that were now consuming what remained of the helicopter. But something in the rhythm of the buzz felt familiar, like a heartbeat she’d forgotten she had.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nThe video began automatically. No buffering, no warning. Just Luna’s face filling the screen—her sister’s daughter, twelve years old and gap-toothed, now bound and blindfolded. A plastic straw protruded from her mouth like a feeding tube. Behind her, another child—Min, Caro’s son—curled into himself, small and terrified.\n\nThe voice that followed was not human. It had been processed through so many filters that only cadence remained, the rise and fall of syllables that belonged in their childhood bedroom in Busan.\n\n“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러.”\n\n*Sleep, my treasure, sing the lullaby.*\n\nIsa’s phone slipped from numb fingers. The video kept playing, now showing the inside of what looked like a shipping container. Metal walls. LED strips casting harsh shadows. The children’s breathing sounded like waves against a shore.\n\nThen: “Return to the river where you buried the truth. You have forty-eight hours.”\n\nThe screen went black. In the distance, sirens wailed—German emergency services responding to the smoke column that now rose above the tree line. Somewhere in the wreckage, Amira stirred and moaned.\n\nIsa stared at the dying fire and understood two things with crystalline clarity:\n\nThe distance she’d spent seventeen years cultivating hadn’t just been geographic. It had been a lie she told herself, a story about safety and separation and the price of running from your own history.\n\nAnd now the river was calling them home.\n\nShe stood, cradling her useless arm against her chest, and began walking toward the sound of approaching sirens. Each step hurt in ways that had nothing to do with dislocated joints or smoke-scorched lungs.\n\nBehind her, the Black Forest burned.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":572,"completion_tokens":1288,"total_tokens":1860,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
