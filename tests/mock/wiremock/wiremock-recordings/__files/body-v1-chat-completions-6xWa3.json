When an urgent email from Grandmother Sun-ja arrives—bearing GPS coordinates to the abandoned DMZ peace garden and a cryptic warning to “come before the 29th”—the sisters race across 5,500 miles to save the land that once anchored their family. Over the next forty-eight hours, blizzards, quarantine lines, and a single Uber ride force them to confront the literal and emotional baggage they’ve carried since the funeral blow-up over a gold locket and the blame it carried. The garden is scheduled for demolition at noon on the 29th, leaving Isa and Caro one frozen night to decide whether the past is worth saving or burying forever.\n\n# Chapter List\n3\n\n# Chapter Details\n\n## Chapter 1: 03:07 Strasbourg / 11:07 Seoul\n### Summary\nAt 3:07 a.m. CET, Isa finishes a code-blue in Strasbourg and finds Grandmother Sun-ja’s email on her cracked phone. The JPEG of ten- and twelve-year-old arms linked in the DMZ peace garden stings more than the locket-shaped scar on her palm. By 3:55 she has booked the last seat on the Seoul-bound flight that lifts off at dawn. Meanwhile, in Songpa, Caro wakes to the same email; her JAG husband is unreachable in a UN bunker, so she stuffs passports, twins, and half of the gold locket into backpacks and boards the eastbound KTX at 12:20 p.m. KST. Both sisters carry the weight of a decade-long silence, unaware their parallel journeys are already tangled by the blizzard barreling toward the Korean peninsula.\n\n### Key Events\n- Isa receives Sun-ja’s email during a post-code-blue lull and books the last seat on the 6:15 a.m. flight.\n- Caro reads the same message, kisses her sleeping husband’s photo, and hustles the twins onto the bullet train.\n- News alerts warn of the heaviest Seoul snowfall in twenty years, expected to hit by nightfall.\n\n## Chapter 2: 14:30 Incheon / 17:00 KTX Eastbound\n### Summary\nIsa lands at Incheon into a snarl of health-declaration tablets and antigen lines; her carry-on is flagged for the antique locket that sets off every metal detector. She bribes a shuttle driver with euros she can’t spare to reach Seoul Station by 17:00, where Caro’s KTX is pulling in late because snow has begun to whip across the tracks. In the chaos of the main hall, the sisters lock eyes for the first time in ten years—each clutching half of a gold heart. Before words form, a civil-defense siren forces evacuation into the blizzard, and they share one Uber whose trunk can’t fit Isa’s suitcase or Caro’s double stroller. The ride stalls on the Olympic Bridge, tires spinning, while the twins sing Disney songs and the sisters finally speak: “You still have the microfilm?” “You still blame me?”\n\n### Key Events\n- Isa clears quarantine but loses her luggage claim ticket in the scramble for taxis.\n- Caro’s train slides into Seoul Station thirty minutes late; the twins spot Isa first from the escalator.\n- Snow strands the Uber on the bridge, forcing the sisters to trade halves of the locket under dome-light glare.\n\n## Chapter 3: 23:55 DMZ Peace Garden / 12:00 29th\n### Summary\nGuided by the GPS pin and a borrowed soldier’s flashlight, the mismatched quartet trudges through knee-deep drifts to the rusted gate of the abandoned garden. Sun-ja’s lantern still hangs from the cherry tree where the photo was taken; beneath it, a fresh mound of earth holds an envelope with the original deed and a note: The land is yours if you keep it together. At 11:57 a.m., bulldozers idle on the perimeter road, engines coughing in the cold. Caro and Isa clasp the rejoined locket, microfilm now useless, and step in front of the machines. Their joint refusal—captured by a reporter live-streaming from the cab—sparks enough public outcry to earn a thirty-day reprieve. As the engines shut off, the sisters finally bury the past: not the garden, but the blame they carried inside it. Snow keeps falling, soft as forgiveness.\n\n### Key Events\n- The flashlight beam reveals Sun-ja’s lantern still swinging, guiding them to the buried envelope.\n- Bulldozers arrive at 11:57; Isa and Caro block the lead machine with their bodies, twins holding the lantern.\n- A viral clip of their standoff halts demolition at 12:00 sharp, giving them thirty days to save the garden—and their family.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":760,"completion_tokens":1048,"total_tokens":1808,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
