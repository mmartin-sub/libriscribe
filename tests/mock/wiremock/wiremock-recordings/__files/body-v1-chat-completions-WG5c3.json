Beyond the glass the Urals shoulder up out of the dusk—granite silhouettes against a bruised sky, pine crowning the ridges like bristled hair. The train rocks and steadies, rocks and steadies, its wheels singing the same minor chord they’ve sung since Berlin. She has listened to that chord for thirty-four hours, long enough for it to etch grooves into her thoughts.\n\nThe envelope rests on her lap, thick enough to prop open the book she never finished reading. The twine that binds it has darkened with the oils of her palms; every time she shifts in the seat the paper rustles like wings trying to decide if they are strong enough. She keeps one hand on it, as though it might leap away and report her cowardice to the mountains.\n\nA child’s voice drifts from the corridor—some game involving a plastic dinosaur and a declaration of war. The syllables are Russian, but the pitch is familiar: the same urgent indignation she once heard from her own sons when one accused the other of stealing the last pear. The memory lands hard, a small stone thrown from a great distance. She presses the envelope closer; the corner digs into her ribs.\n\nThe Wi-Fi she bribed from the conductor flickers in and out, a weak pulse. She opens the airline app, thumbs shaking. The screen offers her a map: Vladivostok to Incheon, a blue arc leaping over the Sea of Japan like a skipped stone. The price glows red, obscene. She hovers, inhales the metallic smell of the radiator and the ghost of burnt coffee from the dining car. For a moment the train feels like a long sentence she is about to punctuate mid-thought.\n\nHer finger taps Purchase before the doubt can speak. The confirmation blooms—seat 42A, departure 18:20 tomorrow. The final leg she swore she would ride all the way, the iron endurance she once bragged about to Caro: I’m not the one who quits, remember? The words taste like rust now. She closes the app, and the screen shows her reflection: hair flattened on one side, the collar of Caro’s old flannel shirt frayed at the throat. She looks like someone who has been traveling for years without arriving anywhere.\n\nThe train tilts, rounding a curve. The envelope slides; she catches it against her heart. Inside, fifteen years of beginnings—I should have told you sooner—each one a small white flag she never raised. She imagines the pages shifting like restless birds, hungry for sky. Her pulse knocks against them, a second train running on parallel rails.\n\nShe stands. The aisle is narrow, carpet thin under her boots. A conductor nods as she passes; his eyes flick to the envelope, to her face, then away—he’s seen passengers carrying heavier secrets. The vestibule between cars smells of diesel and snow. She braces herself against the doorframe, lets the cold slap her cheeks awake. Frost feathers across the outer glass. Somewhere behind her the dining-car steward is locking up, metal shutters clanging like a verdict.\n\nShe lifts the envelope, presses it to the small window. The mountains blur past, indifferent. “Enough,” she whispers, and the word fogs the glass, erasing a slice of the view. She does not wipe it clear. In the smear she sees Caro’s handwriting—imagined but vivid—looping across a fifteen-year-old postcard: Come home when you’re ready to be seen.\n\nThe door to her compartment stands ajar, the berth already stripped by the attendant. Tomorrow she will leave this rolling cradle at Vladivostok and step onto a runway, the envelope still clutched against whatever is left of her. For now she slips inside, pulls the curtain, and lies down fully dressed. The train’s rhythm gathers her—rock, steady, rock—like a promise it never intended to keep. Overhead, the luggage net sways, empty except for the lingering scent of apples and wool.\n\nShe tucks the envelope beneath her cheek, as though it could dream with her. Through the curtain’s gap, the last band of light dies behind the Urals. In the darkness she mouths the city names like beads on a rosary: Vladivostok, Incheon, Seoul. Each one a station farther from the life she outran and closer to the one she must finally face.\n\nThe train slips down the eastern slope, gathering speed toward dawn and a coast she will no longer reach by rail. Outside, the mountains give way to rolling taiga, black and endless. Inside, Isa closes her eyes, the envelope warm against her skin, and begins—at last—to travel.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":571,"completion_tokens":1061,"total_tokens":1632,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
