Caro crosses the threshold in three soundless steps, shoulders hunched against the fluorescent glare that makes every face look bloodless. Her right hand grips the sketchbook so tightly the spiral wire bites the heel of her palm; the left hand is jammed deep in her coat pocket, knuckles white, nails half-mooned into skin.\n\n2:47 glows red on a wall clock that ticks like a metronome keeping time for heartbreak.\n\nShe pauses just inside the waiting room, the soles of her sneakers squeaking once on waxed linoleum. Rows of cold vinyl chairs face a glass partition that separates the living from the almost-living. Beyond the glass: isolettes, webs of tubing, the soft green tracery of monitors. Somewhere in that constellation lies Harper—exhausted, probably sedated—and the infant whose name Caro has not yet dared to say out loud.\n\nCaro’s gaze skitters over other families. A grandmother in quilted hanbok rocks silently, lips moving in prayer. A young father scrolls his phone with a thumb that trembles. No one looks up; the air itself seems to discourage introductions. She chooses a seat at the far end, places the sketchbook on her lap like armor. Its cover—once indigo, now bruise-purple—has gone soft at the corners. Dust clings to the edges; she brushes it away, then wishes she hadn’t, because now the absence of use feels louder.\n\nA monitor beeps, steady but quick. Beep-beep-beep. The pitch matches the pulse she feels in her throat.\n\nShe opens the sketchbook halfway, just enough to see the first sheet. Blank. The tooth of the paper still sharp, untouched. She closes it again, presses it flat against her thighs. Fifteen years ago she would have drawn the entire room in seven lines: the drooping eyelid of the vending machine, the geometry of grief in the grandmother’s shoulders. Tonight her fingers only remember how to tremble.\n\nOutside the tall windows, Seoul glitters frostbitten. The Han River is a dark ribbon threading between apartment blocks where half the city is dreaming, unaware of this small bright cage of hope. A neon pharmacy sign blinks green, then red, then green—traffic lights for the sleepless.\n\nCaro shifts. The vinyl chair exhales a squeak that makes the grandmother glance up. Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second before Caro looks away, studying instead the reflection of the room in the glass: her own pale oval, the sketchbook a blurred rectangle, the distant glow of isolettes like aquariums for angels.\n\nShe checks her phone. 2:49. No messages. Of course not; Harper’s under, the baby’s fighting, and Isa is somewhere between Siberia and here, barefoot if the rumors are true. Caro slips the phone back into her pocket, feels the weight of the sketchbook resettle against her knees. Her own heartbeat is too loud. She counts the beeps of the monitors instead—one Mississippi, two Mississippi—until they sync with her breathing.\n\nA nurse emerges from the sealed doors, calls a name in Korean. The young father leaps up, nearly drops his phone. Caro watches the doors swing shut behind them, a soft pneumatic hush that feels final. She swallows. Her tongue tastes of metal and jet lag and fifteen years of unsent apologies.\n\nShe touches the sketchbook again, this time tracing the spiral wire with one finger, following the cold metal loop by loop until it ends in a sharp, unfinished curl.\n\nThe elevator dings faintly in the corridor. Footsteps—bare?—approach. Caro stiffens, but doesn’t turn. Instead she leans forward, forehead almost against the cool glass, and stares harder into the NICU’s aquarium light, searching for the smallest rise and fall of a tiny chest.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":650,"completion_tokens":886,"total_tokens":1536,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
