Isa is in the third from the aisle, knees together, bare feet cold against the tile. One toe curls, then uncurls, as if testing whether the floor is real. Caro is three seats down, sketchbook balanced on her lap like a hymnal she’s afraid to open. Between them, the chairs are empty, plastic arms aligned like soldiers at ease.\n\nBeep—pause—beep.  \nThe infant’s heart rate rises and falls, a tiny cliffhanger every second.\n\nCaro hears herself swallow. The sound is absurdly loud, so she coughs to disguise it. “When did you land?”\n\n“Two-twenty.” Isa’s voice rustles, unused. “They held the plane in Vladivostok. De-icing.”\n\nA nod from Caro, too fast, as if her neck is hinged. “Long flight.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nBeep—pause—beep.  \nSomewhere behind the glass, a ventilator sighs.\n\nIsa folds her arms across her stomach. She is still wearing the thin cardigan she bought in Terminal D, the label itching the back of her neck. “How long was she in surgery?”\n\n“Hour and a half. Maybe two.” Caro’s thumb traces the sketchbook’s spine. “They said… the left lung wasn’t inflating.”\n\n“But it is now.” Isa says it like a plea.\n\n“They think. Ninety percent.” Caro exhales, a sound that wants to be a laugh and comes out cracked. “Ninety feels like an A-minus when it’s breathing.”\n\nThe elderly couple in the corner shift. The woman’s head slips off her husband’s shoulder and finds it again without waking.\n\nIsa’s gaze drifts to the glass wall. Past it, rows of incubators glow under soft purple lights, each one a private universe. “I should have come sooner.”\n\nCaro turns the sketchbook one quarter. “You came now.”\n\nBeep—pause—beep.\n\nIsa rubs the arch of one foot against the other ankle. “I lost my shoes somewhere over Mongolia. Immigration gave me slippers but they were too small, so I just—” She lifts a foot, skin bluish against the white floor. “Bare. Like a pilgrim.”\n\nCaro’s mouth twitches—a ghost smile, gone before it lands. “You always hated shoes.”\n\n“Still do.”\n\nSilence settles again, not unfriendly, just thick, like wet wool. Isa leans forward, elbows on her knees. The chair’s plastic creaks.\n\n“Harper looks like Mom,” she says to the floor. “Same chin.”\n\nCaro’s fingers tighten on the sketchbook. “I can’t see Mom in her yet. I just see… tubes.”\n\nA nurse appears behind the glass, adjusts something on a monitor, disappears. The beeping quickens—then steadies.\n\nIsa sits back, draws a breath that lifts her shoulders and drops them. “The pilot apologized for the turbulence over the Sea of Okhotsk. Said it was seasonal. Everything’s seasonal, apparently.”\n\nCaro nods because it’s easier than answering. She opens the sketchbook to the back cover—blank, pristine—then closes it again.\n\nIsa watches the motion. “You brought it.”\n\nCaro shrugs, a small lift of one shoulder. “Couldn’t leave it. Couldn’t open it either.”\n\nBeep—pause—beep.\n\nIsa folds her hands as if in prayer, then unfolds them and places them flat on her thighs. “Do they let you hold her yet?”\n\n“Not while she’s on the oscillator. They said tomorrow. Maybe.” Caro’s voice cracks on the last word, and she looks down, blinking fast.\n\nIsa shifts one seat closer. The plastic arms no longer stand like soldiers; one is defeated, angled toward Caro. “May I?” She nods at the sketchbook.\n\nCaro hesitates, then flips to a middle page. The paper is foxed along the edge where a bookmark once lived. A faint charcoal ghost of a wing curls in the corner, half-erased, as if someone tried to rub away flight itself.\n\nIsa touches the edge of the page, not the drawing, careful. “You still draw birds.”\n\n“Not in fifteen years.”\n\nThe ventilator exhales. A soft alarm chimes twice and resolves.\n\nIsa’s fingertip lingers near the wing. “I still have the one you sent from Lhasa. The redstart. It’s in my field journal, pressed between page forty-eight and forty-nine.”\n\nCaro’s eyes flicker, surprised. “I thought you threw everything away.”\n\n“Almost,” Isa says. Her voice is almost steady. “Not that.”\n\nBeep—pause—beep.  \nThe rhythm changes slightly, faster, lighter, as if the baby is dreaming of running.\n\nCaro closes the book, sets it on the chair between them but not exactly in the middle—an inch closer to Isa. “I should call Jinwoo.”\n\n“He’s outside,” Isa says. “He texted. Said he’s with Luc and coffee.” She pauses. “Two lattes and one Americano. He guessed you’d want the Americano.”\n\nCaro’s eyes fill, and she turns her head so Isa can’t see. “He always guesses right.”\n\nIsa lets the moment stand, then moves again—one more seat, closing the gap so the sketchbook is now within reach of both. The monitors murmur like distant surf.\n\nCaro wipes her eyes with the heel of her hand. “I’m scared she’ll stop breathing if I leave this room.”\n\nIsa nods. “I know. I watched thirty-seven babies stop breathing in a camp outside Irkutsk. I left the room every time. They still—” She stops, throat working. “They still started again. Mostly.”\n\nSilence, but thinner now, threadbare rather than woolen.\n\nCaro looks at her sister’s bare feet, the blue of veins under skin. “You must be freezing.”\n\n“I’ve been colder.” Isa’s smile is crooked, apologetic. “Siberia teaches you the difference between cold and lonely.”\n\nBeep—pause—beep.  \nA lull, almost musical.\n\nCaro pulls the thin hospital blanket from the back of her chair, offers it. Isa takes it, unfolds it over her lap, then folds it again and drapes half across Caro’s knees too. The blanket is the color of dishwater, flannel worn soft. Their knees do not quite touch in the middle, but the cloth bridges the space.\n\nOutside the window, the first vending machine clicks on, humming awake. The corridor lights dim to night-mode, a softer yellow.\n\nCaro’s voice is almost a whisper. “When we were kids, you used to lie on the floor and draw maps on my back with your finger.”\n\n“I remember,” Isa says. “Latitude lines first. Always latitude.”\n\n“Because they were forgiving. They curved.”\n\n“Longitudes made me anxious. All that running together at the poles.”\n\nA huff that might be a laugh escapes Caro. “You haven’t changed.”\n\n“Nor have you.” Isa’s hand hovers above the sketchbook, palm open. “May I?”\n\nCaro nods.\n\nIsa opens to the fresh, final page. The paper is thick, toothy, waiting. A single graphite smudge mars the top edge where the book has rubbed against something. Isa sticks her finger in her mouth, rubs the smudge gently; it lightens but doesn’t vanish.\n\nBeep—pause—beep.  \nSteady now, a quiet drum.\n\nCaro watches her sister’s face instead of the page. “I don’t know what to draw first.”\n\n“Draw a line,” Isa says. “Just one. Horizontal. Thirty-seventh parallel, if you want to be precise.” She pulls a cheap ballpoint from her cardigan pocket, clicks it once, and offers it.\n\nCaro hesitates, then takes the pen. The plastic is warm from Isa’s hand.\n\nFor a moment they sit, the pen hovering, the monitor keeping its gentle time.\n\nCaro lowers the pen to the paper. The felt tip kisses the surface, leaving a single, pale blue dash—\n\nThe door at the end of the hallway opens. Light spills in. A nurse appears, scrubs rumpled, eyes soft with fatigue. She lifts a hand in greeting. Caro and Isa look up as one.\n\n“Parents of Harper Kang?” the nurse asks.\n\nCaro’s hand tightens on the pen. Isa’s fingers brush the back of her wrist.\n\nThe beeping quickens—excited, not alarmed—and the scene tilts toward whatever comes next.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":628,"completion_tokens":1929,"total_tokens":2557,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
