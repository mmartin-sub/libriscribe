Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, washing the hallway in a sickly peach glow. She clutches the sketchbook—edges warped from humidity and years of silence—against her chest like a life vest. Her palm sweats through the leather cover.\n\nThe waiting room door slides open with a hydraulic whisper. Empty chairs face a wall of glass that separates the hush of anxious parents from the soft, relentless beeping of monitors. Beyond the glass, rows of isolettes glow under warmer lights. Tubes snake into impossibly small bodies. One of them contains Harper’s baby—Harper, who used to steal Caro’s lipsticks in high school and now lies somewhere above, unconscious from an emergency C-section at twenty-seven weeks.\n\nCaro chooses the chair farthest from the glass. She sets the sketchbook on her lap but does not open it. Instead, she stares at her reflection: black hair escaping its bun, eyes swollen from the flight from New York, the ghost of Seoul’s winter fog still clinging to her coat. She smells like recycled airplane air and the gin she drank to steady her hands.\n\nThe elevator dings again. Bare feet whisper across linoleum. Caro looks up.\n\nIsa stands in the doorway, shoes missing, coat unbuttoned over a silk dress that might have been elegant twelve hours ago. Her dark curls are matted on one side, as if she slept against a train window. A thin line of dried blood traces her left ankle—she must have cut herself on something between the airport and here. She carries nothing.\n\nFor a moment, they stare at each other across the waiting room’s beige carpet. The monitors beep steadily. A nurse adjusts a dial in the NICU, her movements precise and practiced.\n\n“I didn’t know you were coming,” Caro says. Her voice cracks on the last word.\n\n“I didn’t either,” Isa replies. She takes one tentative step closer, then another. Her bare feet leave faint damp prints on the carpet. “Not until the plane was over the Sea of Okhotsk. Then it was just… here.”\n\nCaro’s fingers tighten on the sketchbook. The leather creaks. “How long were you in Siberia?”\n\n“Three weeks. Maybe four. Time moves differently when the sun doesn’t.” Isa stops three chairs away. Close enough to see the exhaustion pooling beneath Caro’s eyes. “Is she—”\n\n“Stable. For now.” Caro gestures vaguely toward the glass. “They won’t let me see him yet. Too soon.”\n\nIsa nods. She lowers herself into a chair, pulling her knees to her chest. The silk dress rides up, revealing more scrapes on her legs. “I came straight from Incheon. The immigration officer asked about my shoes. I told him I lost them between Moscow and mercy.”\n\nA laugh escapes Caro before she can stop it—sharp, startled, immediately regretted. She clamps a hand over her mouth. Isa’s eyes widen, then soften.\n\n“That’s the first time I’ve heard you laugh in fifteen years,” Isa says quietly.\n\nCaro’s hand drops. The air between them trembles, fragile as eggshell. “I wasn’t sure I remembered how.”\n\nThey sit in silence. The monitors continue their steady song. Somewhere behind the glass, a baby—Harper’s baby—breathes through a tube that looks too large for his face. Caro watches the rise and fall of the tiny chest and feels something crack open inside her, small and painful as a splinter.\n\n“I kept them,” she says suddenly. “The letters. All of them. Even the ones I never answered.”\n\nIsa’s head snaps up. “You—what?”\n\n“Every email. Every postcard. Every stupid scribble you sent from places I couldn’t pronounce.” Caro’s voice drops to a whisper. “They’re in the sketchbook. Between the pages. Like pressed flowers.”\n\nIsa unfolds slowly from her chair. She takes one step, then another, until she stands directly in front of Caro. Her bare toes touch Caro’s boots. “May I?”\n\nCaro hesitates. Then she opens the sketchbook—not to the letters, but to a blank page. The paper is thick, slightly yellowed. A single charcoal smudge mars the upper corner where the book once pressed against something dirty.\n\n“I stopped drawing the day you left,” Caro says. “But I kept buying the paper. Just in case.”\n\nIsa kneels. The carpet must be cold against her scraped knees, but she doesn’t flinch. “May I?” she asks again, reaching toward the sketchbook.\n\nThis time, Caro nods.\n\nIsa’s fingers brush the blank page. Her touch is reverent, as if the paper might dissolve. “Do you remember the last thing we drew together?”\n\n“The bridge,” Caro answers without hesitation. “That stupid rope bridge in Jeju. You said it looked like a smile stretched too tight.”\n\n“It broke three months later. Storm took it clean away.” Isa’s voice is steady, but her hand trembles. “I thought about that bridge every time I crossed another one. How we stood in the middle and swore we’d never fall.”\n\nThe monitors beep. A nurse writes something on a clipboard. The baby’s chest rises, falls.\n\nCaro closes the sketchbook gently. “I thought if I opened this, everything would come rushing out. The anger. The questions. The—” She stops. The word forgiveness lodges in her throat like a fish bone.\n\nIsa sits back on her heels. “We don’t have to do this now.”\n\n“No,” Caro says. “We do. Because in five hours, Harper will wake up. And her baby will either breathe on his own or he won’t. And if we wait for the perfect moment—” She gestures at the waiting room, the glass wall, the endless beeping. “This is as perfect as it gets.”\n\nIsa looks at her for a long moment. Then she nods. “Start with the fellowship.”\n\nCaro’s breath hitches. “The fellowship.” She stares down at her hands. “I didn’t withdraw my application. They rejected you because I sent them that painting. The one you hated. The one of—”\n\n“Of me drowning,” Isa finishes. Her voice is soft. “I know. I found the letter in your trash.”\n\nThe air stills. Caro waits for the explosion, the accusations. Instead, Isa reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out a folded photograph. She smooths it on the carpet between them.\n\nIt’s the painting. But someone—Isa?—has drawn over it in red ink. Not to destroy, but to transform. The drowning figure now stands in shallow water, arms outstretched. Above her, a bridge arcs solid and whole, its ropes no longer frayed.\n\n“I carried this for twelve years,” Isa says. “From Tangier to Tashkent. I kept trying to give it back to you, but I never knew how to apologize for surviving.”\n\nCaro stares at the photograph. The red ink has bled slightly, making the bridge look like it’s glowing. “I painted it the day I found out about the baby. The first one. Yours.”\n\n“I know.” Isa’s hand hovers over the image. “I read about it in the news. The evacuation. All those babies you got out of Aleppo. I wanted to write, but I thought—”\n\n“That I blamed you,” Caro finishes. “For choosing them over us.”\n\nIsa nods. Her eyes are bright, but no tears fall. “I did choose them. And I don’t know how to live with that.”\n\nThe monitors beep faster for a moment, then settle. A doctor checks a monitor and nods to someone beyond the glass.\n\nCaro takes a shaky breath. “The baby in Aleppo. The one you carried out. Did she—”\n\n“Live? Yes.” Isa’s smile is small and sad. “But she doesn’t remember me. They never do. I’m just the woman who got them to the border, then disappeared into the next crisis.”\n\n“But I remember,” Caro says. “I remember every article. Every photo. Every time I saw your face on the news and wanted to scream at the screen.”\n\nIsa looks down at her bare feet. “I sent you a letter from Lesbos. Did you—”\n\n“I read it,” Caro interrupts. “All thirty pages. Then I put it in the sketchbook and didn’t sleep for a week.”\n\nThey sit with this. The space between them feels charged, electric. Caro can hear her own heartbeat in her ears.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Isa says finally. “Not for the work. For how I left. The note on your pillow like some cliché. I thought if I disappeared completely, it would hurt less.”\n\n“It didn’t,” Caro says. “It just made the hurt quieter. More polite.”\n\nIsa huffs a laugh that sounds suspiciously like a sob. “Polite hurt. That sounds about right.”\n\nCaro shifts the sketchbook to her other lap. The leather is warm now from her hands. “Your turn. The letters you stopped sending.”\n\nIsa presses her palms together. “I wrote you every month for six years. Then I had a miscarriage in a field hospital outside Mosul. After that, I couldn’t write anymore. Every time I picked up a pen, I saw that empty space where the baby should have been. And I thought—how do I tell Caro that I can save everyone else’s children but not my own?”\n\nThe word miscarriage hangs between them like a held note. Caro reaches out instinctively, then pulls her hand back.\n\n“I didn’t know,” she whispers.\n\n“No one did. I told them it was shrapnel. Easier than explaining.” Isa’s voice is steady, but her hands shake. “I kept writing to you in my head. Long letters about the taste of dust in Kabul, the smell of orange blossoms in Damascus. But none of them ever made it to paper.”\n\nCaro opens the sketchbook again. This time, she flips past the blank pages to the back cover. Tucked inside is a small envelope, yellowed and creased. She holds it out.\n\n“I wrote this the day you left. Never mailed it.”\n\nIsa takes the envelope with both hands, as if it weighs more than paper. She doesn’t open it. Instead, she places it carefully on the carpet between them, next to the red-lined photograph.\n\n“I think,” Isa says slowly, “we’ve been writing to ghosts.”\n\nCaro nods. “And now?”\n\nIsa looks toward the glass wall. Beyond it, the baby has been joined by another—smaller, more fragile. A nurse adjusts a tube with movements so gentle they seem like prayer.\n\n“Now,” Isa says, “we start writing to each other again.”\n\nThey sit in silence, not touching, but no longer apart. The monitors beep steadily. Somewhere above them, Harper sleeps off anesthesia, dreaming of babies and bridges and the moment when two sisters learned to breathe in the same room again.\n\nThe elevator dings. Footsteps approach—different shoes for different lives, converging on this small, sterile space. But for now, in this moment, it is only the two of them and the soft, relentless sound of a heart learning to beat on its own.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":657,"completion_tokens":2449,"total_tokens":3106,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
