Caro reluctantly shares a childhood memory of the lullaby’s origin, hinting at a fragile truce as they prepare to cross into Baden-Württemberg.\n\nThe civic’s headlights cut a dim tunnel through the fog rolling off the Neckar, silver needles of rain stabbing the windshield. Isa killed the engine beside a picnic pull-off whose tables squatted like darkened sarcophagi. Beyond the guardrail the river ran black and fast, its surface flicking light back at the sodium lamps. Klaus stepped out first, coat collar high, cigarette cupped in one hand. Ji-eun lingered near the hood, tablet glowing against the night.\n\nInside the car the dashboard clock read 02:17. Caro’s phone buzzed on the center console, speaker crackling.\n\n“Mom, I’m in,” Hana said, voice thin with adrenaline. “Russian Railways subnet thought six-factor was enough—cute.” Rapid keystrokes sounded like hail on metal. “Okay, camera 14B just pinged the freight train at Omsk, timestamp twenty-three minutes ago. Same container ID: BGX-777-KR. Eastbound on the Trans-Sib mainline.”\n\nIsa leaned forward, damp hair brushing Caro’s shoulder. “ETA to Vladivostok?”\n\n“At current speed—three days, ten hours, assuming no sidings or bribes. Satellite weather shows a storm front over the Urals; could add half a day.”\n\nCaro rubbed her temples. “We’ll be neck-deep in Bavarian snow by then. Keep the feed open.”\n\n“It’s chewing bandwidth,” Hana warned. “I’ve got a relay piggybacking a Roscosmos weather sat, but it’ll decay in four hours.”\n\n“Four hours is luxury,” Klaus muttered through the open window. Smoke ghosted around his words.\n\nJi-eun tapped the tablet. “Next coordinate from the capsule: 49.4875° N, 8.4669° E—that’s still Mannheim, but the Rhine crossing is behind us. The Neckar waypoint must be verification, not destination.”\n\n“Or a breadcrumb,” Isa said. “Luna likes loops.”\n\nCaro opened the glove box and drew out the silver capsule they’d pried from the bridge lattice hours earlier. The flash drive dangled like a tiny sword. She stared at the Korean hanja etched inside the cap: 잠이 들어도 꿈은 날아간다—Even in sleep, dreams take flight.\n\nA sudden hush fell, broken only by the river and the soft rustle of rain. Isa watched Caro trace the characters with a fingertip, the gesture hesitant, almost tender.\n\n“You used to hum that line,” Caro said quietly, eyes still on the metal. “At the hospital, after Dad left the second time. You were twelve, maybe thirteen. I hated you for sounding like Mom.”\n\nIsa’s throat worked. “I didn’t know you were listening.”\n\n“I hid on the landing.” Caro’s laugh was small, cracked. “You sat on the piano bench in your school uniform, rocking like she used to. I thought if I came down, you’d stop, and I didn’t want the song to end.”\n\nRain drummed on the roof. Isa reached into her jacket and produced the folded page—Hana’s transcription of the lullaby fragments. She smoothed it against the steering wheel. “We have two stanzas now. If the next line is at the Neckar, maybe the river keeps the rest.”\n\n“Rivers don’t keep,” Caro said. “They carry away.”\n\nIsa flinched but didn’t retreat. “Then let’s move before the current wins.”\n\nHeadlights flared behind them—Klaus, ready to roll. Ji-eun climbed into the back seat, tablet balanced on her knees like a prayer book. Caro twisted the key; the engine coughed awake. She eased onto the wet road, tires hissing. In the rearview the picnic tables receded, then vanished as fog swallowed them.\n\n“Hana,” Caro said, “patch the feed to the windshield HUD once we hit the autobahn. If the container stalls, I want to see it before the Russians do.”\n\n“Copy. And Mom… the lullaby.” A pause, soft as breath. “Grandma used to sing it to me over video chat. Same key you hum. Thought you should know.”\n\nCaro’s grip tightened on the wheel. The car crested the rise; ahead, the highway signs gleamed green and white. BADEN-WÜRTTEMBERG 42 KM.\n\nBeside her, Isa began to hum—low, tentative. The melody threaded the space between them, fragile as frost. Caro didn’t join, but her foot eased on the accelerator, matching the tempo. For the first time in a thousand kilometers, the silence felt less like a wall and more like a bridge.\n\nSomewhere beyond the river the container rattled east, carrying its red secret toward the Pacific. The sisters followed, one remembered note at a time.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":698,"completion_tokens":1107,"total_tokens":1805,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
