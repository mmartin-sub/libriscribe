Klaus, a German pilot, intervenes to force a tense alliance, while Ji-eun, a K-pop logistics prodigy, shares a decoded clue pointing to Mannheim.\n\nThe wind off the Hunsrück whipped rain sideways, needling the skin like ground glass. Sodium lamps glazed the wet concrete in fractured gold, and the twin-engine Beechcraft glistened like it had been dipped in mercury. Under its wing, a woman in a dove-gray trench coat stood motionless, clutching a slim leather folio against her ribs as though keeping her heart from leaping out. Dr. Isadora Mendoza—half-Spaniard, half-Korean, all fury—hadn’t waited inside the terminal. She wanted to meet Caro on neutral ground, where the cameras ended and the sky began.\n\nHeadlights knifed through the curtain of rain. A black BMW emergency-braked beside the plane, tires hissing. The rear door opened and Park Caro unfolded herself—taller than memory, black hair shorn to a severe bob, army surplus jacket over a hanbok collar the color of bruised plums. She carried nothing. She had never believed in baggage.\n\nFor a second the only sound was the ticking of cooling engines and the wet slap of wind against fuselage. Then Caro’s boots crunched across the tarmac, each step measured, deliberate. Isa’s knuckles whitened on the folio.\n\nFifteen years, and the first word belonged to the weather.\n\n“They said it would be sleet,” Caro said, voice flat, as though the forecast had personally betrayed her.\n\n“I don’t remember asking for a reunion tour,” Isa replied. Rain beaded on her lashes; she refused to blink.\n\nA silhouette ducked out of the cockpit—broad shoulders, bomber jacket, gray stubble cut sharp along the jawline. Klaus Reuter tossed a pair of chocks onto the ground like dice. “Ladies,” he called, Bavarian vowels rounding the word into something almost warm, “this bird is fueled and filed. If you intend to stand here until pneumonia sets in, kindly do it on your own medical insurance.”\n\nNeither sister moved.\n\nJi-eun emerged from the shadows near the cargo hatch, neon pink raincoat blinding under the floodlights. She balanced a tablet in one hand and a bubble-tea straw between her teeth. At twenty-four she had already rerouted three world tours through monsoons and visa strikes; nothing about tonight seemed to dent her gloss. She tapped the screen, and a green holographic grid floated above it like spilled coolant.\n\n“Coordinate packet decrypted,” she chirped. “Our ghost left us a breadcrumb—49.4875° N, 8.4669° E. That’s the Konrad Adenauer Bridge, Mannheim. Twelve-minute flight time if we skip de-ice.” She offered the tablet to Isa, then seemed to think better and angled it toward Caro instead. Diplomacy through gadget placement.\n\nCaro glanced at the numbers, lips compressing. “Mom’s bridge,” she said. The words cracked like thawing ice.\n\nIsa flinched almost imperceptibly. “We don’t know this is about her.”\n\nCaro’s laugh scraped. “Of course not. Random psychopaths always scatter GPS poetry over the Rhine.”\n\nKlaus stepped between them, palms raised. “My hangar, my rules. Grief later, altitude now. Mendoza, your medical kit’s aboard. Park, I’ve got a thermos of yuja-cha that hasn’t gone cold yet. Both of you—inside before customs wonders why a retired Bundeswehr pilot is running a midnight taxi service.”\n\nFor a heartbeat, the only thing louder than the rain was the sisters’ resistance. Then Caro moved first, brushing past Isa close enough that the wool of their coats snagged for an instant, a static spark snapping between them. Isa smelled the starched collar of her own lab coat under the trench, the ghost of antiseptic she could never quite scrub off. Caro smelled of wet camellia and gun oil.\n\nInside the cabin, amber LEDs glowed like embers. Ji-eun slid into the jump seat behind the cockpit, already scrolling Russian rail-cam footage. Klaus sealed the hatch, muffling the storm to a wet heartbeat against aluminum. Isa buckled herself opposite Caro at the small fold-out table; the distance between their knees was exactly the width of the folio Isa set down like a barrier.\n\nCaro’s gaze tracked to the folio. “Still forging paperwork?”\n\n“Still collecting evidence,” Isa countered. She flicked the clasp, revealing a single photograph inside: two girls on a ferry railing, Han River glittering behind them, one laughing, one already looking away. She snapped it shut again.\n\nKlaus’s voice floated back from the cockpit. “Flight time eleven minutes. Seatbelts or not, we’re wheels-up in thirty.”\n\nJi-eun swiveled her screen toward them. A grainy CCTV still: a teal freight container stenciled with the letters МСК-4721, riding flatbed 07 on the Trans-Siberian, timestamped three hours ago. “Hana’s ghosting the cams,” Ji-eun said. “Train’s heading east, velocity steady. If we keep leapfrogging, we intercept in Vladivostok before customs clears the manifest.”\n\nCaro’s jaw worked. “How old is your daughter?”\n\n“Eight,” Isa whispered.\n\n“Mine’s ten.” Caro stared at the aisle floor as if she could bore straight through to the rails beneath. “They’re scared and moving toward the edge of the world. We don’t have time for your righteous silence.”\n\nIsa’s reply was cut short by the engines winding up, a low moan that climbed into a howl. The plane lurched forward, rain streaking sideways across the windows like silver scars. As they rolled onto the runway, cabin lights dimmed to tactical red. On the table between them, Ji-eun set a small waterproof capsule no bigger than a shotgun shell—the kind divers use for car keys. She nudged it across until it touched both of their hands.\n\n“Found this taped to the underside of the flap actuator,” she said. “It wasn’t there at pre-flight.”\n\nThrough the translucent casing glinted a flash drive and a folded slip of hanja inked in blood-red brushstrokes. Caro’s breath hitched; Isa felt it in her own lungs, a twin catch.\n\nThe Beechcraft lifted, the ground falling away into black mosaic. Somewhere below, the Rhine coiled like a steel ribbon. Ahead, the 37th Parallel waited, a scar across continents and memory.\n\nCaro unfolded the slip with trembling fingers. The lullaby—first line in their mother’s hand. Isa read over her shoulder, translating in a whisper neither of them had meant to share:\n\n“Little boats set sail before dawn…”\n\nThey looked at each other, rain still dripping from their hair, engines hammering toward Mannheim, and for a moment the resentment was eclipsed by something colder: recognition.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":705,"completion_tokens":1540,"total_tokens":2245,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
