Snow muffles their screams, but neither backs down.\n\nWind scours the courtyard, whipping snow into needles. The listening post looms behind them, metal ribs glowing red where embers cling. Blood—someone’s blood—has frozen in rust-black petals across the threshold. Isa’s breath fogs and snaps away like torn gauze. Caro stands opposite, boots planted, fists balled so tight the knuckles bleach.\n\n“Say it again,” Caro snarls. “Say my grandfather was a butcher.”\n\nIsa’s reply is a shard of ice. “He guided the shells. You know it, I know it.”\n\nSnow swallows the echo. The sky above the border is colorless, a lid pressed down on the world. Caro steps forward; crusted snow groans under her weight. “He was nineteen. They told him civilians had evacuated. They lied to him the way they lied to us all.”\n\n“And you kept lying.” Isa’s voice cracks. “Twenty-eight years. You buried the report with him so your family’s name stayed clean.”\n\nCaro flinches, but only once. “What choice did I have? You think Pyongyang differentiates between one Park and the next? Upload that file and my nieces, my cousins, every kid with my blood—”\n\n“—gets on a watch list.” Isa spits the words. “They’ll live. The villagers didn’t.”\n\nThe wind cuts sideways, driving snow against their cheeks like sand. Somewhere inside the container Luna coughs—a thin sound, almost lost. Caro’s shoulders twitch toward the door, then lock. “You’re so pure, Mendoza? You signed the same blackout clauses. You stood in that cholera ward and let the North Korean officer dictate who got medicine first. Don’t lecture me about bodies on the ground.”\n\nIsa feels the accusation strike bone. The night in ’96 rushes back: lanterns guttering, the stench of bleach and cordite, Caro’s grandfather—barely more than a boy—translating threats while Isa pressed compresses to a child whose lung hissed air. She had swallowed the order. She had chosen the mission.\n\n“I stayed to save who I could,” she says.\n\n“You stayed to save yourself.” Caro’s boots crunch closer. “Your license. Your precious neutrality. You think MSF would’ve kept you after a massacre scandal? You would’ve been radioactive.”\n\nSnowflakes catch in Isa’s lashes, melt, run like tears she refuses to shed. “And you think burying it saved anyone? Look at Luna. Look at Min. The river keeps demanding payment, Caro. It just changes currency.”\n\nCaro’s laugh is a choked thing. “The river? That’s rich from the woman who let a lullaby be the last thing those kids heard.” She jerks her chin toward the burning post; inside, the laptop’s screen still pulses the final line like a heartbeat. Blood is thicker than water, but water washes everything away.\n\nIsa steps until they are an arm’s length apart. Breath mingles, white on white. “Your grandfather’s signature is on the artillery map. Not mine.”\n\n“Your initials are on the redaction.” Caro’s finger stabs the air between them. “Page twelve, paragraph three—‘civilians observed, numbers indeterminate.’ Gone because you agreed.”\n\nThe words hang, crystallize. Snow sifts down the collar of Isa’s coat; it might as well be guilt. She thinks of the children inside, wired to a stranger’s revenge, and the weight feels unbearable.\n\n“I can’t change what I did,” she whispers. “But I can stop lying now.”\n\nCaro’s face contorts—rage, grief, something rawer. “If we release that file, they’ll erase us. All of us. My family becomes ghosts.”\n\n“Then be ghosts who told the truth.” Isa’s voice is quiet enough that only the wind carries it. “Or stay alive and keep pretending the river never flooded.”\n\nFor a moment neither moves. The snow thickens, erasing boot prints as fast as they form. A timber inside the post cracks, loud as a gunshot. Sparks whirl skyward and die.\n\nCaro’s shoulders sag; the fight drains so suddenly she looks deflated. When she speaks again, the anger is gone, replaced by something harder. “If we do this, we do it together. All the consequences. No martyrs, no saints.”\n\nIsa nods once. The motion loosens the ice in her hair; it falls like broken glass.\n\nBehind them, the container door rattles. Luna’s voice leaks through the steel, small but steady. “Mom? Auntie Caro? We’re still here.”\n\nThe women turn. Snow hisses against the burning post, and the lullaby line flickers on the laptop screen one last time before the fire eats the wire.\n\nIsa reaches out. Caro’s gloved hand finds hers. They clasp—not in forgiveness, not yet, but in the simple animal need to walk into the next second without letting go.\n\nThe courtyard stretches ahead, white and unmarked.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":648,"completion_tokens":1116,"total_tokens":1764,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
