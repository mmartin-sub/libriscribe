The sisters haven’t touched in seven years—until a single email containing a childhood photograph, a set of coordinates, and the line, ‘We are losing the thread.’ With no explanation, Isa books a red-eye east and Caro boards a westbound train, each carrying half of a torn family locket. Between them lie 5,500 miles, two passports, one blizzard, and the sudden certainty that the distance they accepted was never geography—it was fear. As they zigzag toward the DMZ’s abandoned peace garden where their story began, the women must choose between the safe lives they have engineered and the raw, messy love that once made them fearless. A novella-length Hero’s Journey told in alternating voices, The Invisible Thread asks how far we will travel to forgive the people who know our first names and our worst mistakes.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":323,"total_tokens":513,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
