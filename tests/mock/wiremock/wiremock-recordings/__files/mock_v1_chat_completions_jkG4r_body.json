are creating 8 main characters for the book \"Half a Map, Half the World\".\n The two sisters, Isa Moreau and Caro Han, are given. We need 6 more.\n The book description gives us:\n   - Isa Moreau: ICU nurse in Strasbourg, estranged from her sister, mother had a stroke.\n   - Caro Han: Diplomat's wife in Seoul.\n\n We also know:\n   - Each sister drags a reluctant child.\n   - They are racing to a rendezvous before a total lunar eclipse.\n\n So, we can have:\n   1. Isa Moreau (sister 1)\n   2. Caro Han (sister 2)\n   3. Child of Isa (let's say a son, age around 10-12)\n   4. Child of Caro (let's say a daughter, age around 10-12)\n\n Then we need 4 more main characters.\n\n Possibilities:\n   - The late mother (but she is dead, so might not be a \"main character\" in the active story? However, the book description says she had a stroke and then died? Actually, the stroke \"fells\" her, and then they are racing to a rendezvous. It says \"late mother\", so she is dead. But we can have her as a character through memories? However, the requirement is for 8 main characters that are active in the story. Let's avoid dead characters as main characters for the journey.)\n\n   - The diplomat husband? But the book description says Caro is a diplomat's wife, so we might have the husband.\n\n   - Other characters: \n        * A guide or someone who helps them? \n        * An antagonist? The book description doesn't mention an antagonist explicitly, but there might be someone blocking them? \n        * The rendezvous person? (the mysterious rendezvous)\n\n Let's think of the story: they are racing to a rendezvous. So there must be someone they are meeting? Or a place? The book says: \"to reach a mysterious rendezvous\". So it could be a person or a place.\n\n Also, the book description says: \"on the banks of the Rhine, where the tracks that once connected Europe were torn up in 1962\". So the rendezvous is at a specific location.\n\n But note: the book says \"the sisters discover that the map was never about geography\". So the rendezvous might be symbolic? However, they are racing to a physical location.\n\n We are told: 8 main characters.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n 1. Isa Moreau\n 2. Caro Han\n 3. Isa's child (let's name him Leo, age 11)\n 4. Caro's child (let's name her Min-jee, age 10)\n 5. The diplomat husband (Caro's husband, let's name him David Han, but note: Caro Han, so she took his last name? But Han is a Korean name, so David Han might be Korean? However, Caro is likely not Korean? The book says \"Caro Han\", and she is a diplomat's wife in Seoul. So Caro might be Western? But the name Han is Korean. So let's assume David Han is Korean, and Caro is Western (maybe American?).\n\n However, the book is in US-English, and the characters are from various backgrounds.\n\n 6. We need an antagonist? Or a helper? The book description doesn't mention an antagonist, but there might be one. Alternatively, the journey itself is the antagonist? But we need characters.\n\n Another idea: the mother had a secret? Maybe a friend of the mother who is involved? Or someone who is also after the map?\n\n But the book says: \"the torn halves of their late mother’s hand-drawn atlas\". So it's personal. However, maybe there is a third party? The book doesn't specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n\n 5. A person at the rendezvous? (e.g., the mother's old friend who is waiting for them)\n\n 6. A border guard or someone who obstructs them? But that might be a minor character.\n\n Let's read the book description again: \"Traveling by slow trains, night ferries, and a border the internet says is closed\"\n\n So there might be a closed border (maybe between North and South Korea? But Caro is in Seoul, so South Korea). The closed border could be the DMZ? But the rendezvous is on the Rhine? So that doesn't match.\n\n Actually, the rendezvous is on the Rhine (in Europe). So the sisters are traveling from Strasbourg (Europe) and Seoul (Asia) to meet at the Rhine.\n\n How do they get from Seoul to the Rhine? They might cross through multiple countries.\n\n The book says: \"a border the internet says is closed\" — this could be a border in Europe? Or in Asia? But the rendezvous is in Europe.\n\n Also, note: \"the tracks that once connected Europe were torn up in 1962\" — this refers to a specific place on the Rhine? Maybe the inner German border? But that was torn up in 1945? Actually, the inner German border was established in 1945 and the Berlin Wall in 1961. But the book says 1962. So it might be fictional.\n\n We can create:\n\n 5. A mysterious contact (the person they are supposed to meet at the rendezvous) — let's call him Emil Vogel. He was the mother's lover? Or a friend from the past?\n\n 6. A government agent who is trying to stop them? Maybe because the mother was involved in some historical event? (e.g., the torn tracks in 1962 might be related to a Cold War incident)\n\n 7. A guide? But the book doesn't mention one.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n\n 5. The diplomat husband (David Han) — he might be trying to stop Caro from going? Or he might join them? But the book says \"Caro—a diplomat’s wife in Seoul\" is traveling with a reluctant child, so the husband might not be with them. But he could be a main character.\n\n 6. The mother's best friend who knows the secret? \n\n 7. A rival who also has a claim to the map? But the map is torn in half and each sister has one half.\n\n 8. The child's perspective? But we already have two children.\n\n After careful thought, I propose:\n\n 1. Isa Moreau\n 2. Caro Han\n 3. Leo Moreau (Isa's son, 11)\n 4. Min-jee Han (Caro's daughter, 10)\n 5. David Han (Caro's husband, 45) — he is a diplomat, so he might be involved in the journey? Or he might be an obstacle? The book says Caro is a diplomat's wife, so she is married to David. He might not want her to leave her post? So he could be a conflict for Caro.\n 6. Emil Vogel (70s) — the man waiting for them at the rendezvous. He was the mother's lover during the Cold War? And the torn tracks refer to a railway line he and the mother sabotaged in 1962? (fictional event)\n 7. Klaus Bauer (50s) — a German border official who is suspicious of their journey and tries to stop them? But the border is closed? So he is the one enforcing the closure? But the book says the internet says it's closed, but they cross anyway. So he might be an antagonist.\n 8. We need one more. How about a friend of Isa? Or a colleague? But the book says Isa is an ICU nurse, so maybe a close friend who helps her at the beginning? But that might not be main. Alternatively, the mother's nurse? But the mother is dead.\n\n Another idea: the mother had a twin sister? Or a sibling who is still alive and knows the secret? Let's make it:\n\n 8. Margot Dubois (68) — the mother's twin sister, who lives in Strasbourg and is the one who gives Isa the half-map? Or she might be the one who set up the rendezvous? But the book says the mother drew the atlas and left it to the sisters.\n\n However, the book description says: \"the stroke that fells their mother erases twenty years of silence overnight\" — meaning the mother had a stroke and then died? Or the stroke caused her to die? And then they found the map? So the mother is dead.\n\n So Margot could be the aunt, who is holding the other half? But no, the map is torn in half and each sister gets one half.\n\n Alternatively, Margot could be the one who knows the meaning of the map.\n\n But let's stick to 8:\n\n 1. Isa Moreau\n 2. Caro Han\n 3. Leo Moreau\n 4. Min-jee Han\n 5. David Han (Caro's husband)\n 6. Emil Vogel (the rendezvous person)\n 7. Klaus Bauer (border official, antagonist)\n 8. Margot Dubois (the mother's twin sister, who lives in Strasbourg and is Isa's confidante)\n\n Now, let's create detailed profiles for each.\n\n Important: \n   - All in US-English.\n   - Personality traits as a comma-separated string (not array).\n   - JSON array of 8 character objects.\n\n Let's define:\n\n For Isa Moreau:\n   Name: Isa Moreau\n   Age: 42 (she's an ICU nurse, and has an 11-year-old son, so she had him at 31, which is plausible)\n   Physical: \n        - Short, curly dark hair often tied back in a messy bun, with streaks of gray at the temples.\n        - Tired eyes with faint crow's feet from squinting at monitors, pale skin from night shifts.\n        - Wears practical, comfortable clothes: scrubs under a worn denim jacket, sneakers, and a silver locket (from her mother).\n   Personality: Compassionate, Resentful, Pragmatic, Stubborn, Protective\n   Background: Grew up in Strasbourg with her sister Caro, but left home at 18 after a big fight with her mother and sister. Became a nurse to help people, but carries guilt for not being there when her mother had the stroke. Has been raising Leo alone since her husband left when Leo was 2.\n   Motivations: To understand her mother's last message and to reconnect with her sister, but also to protect her son from the journey's dangers.\n   Relationships: \n        - Sister of Caro Han (estranged for 20 years)\n        - Mother of Leo Moreau\n        - Niece of Margot Dubois (her mother's twin)\n        - Has a professional relationship with colleagues at the hospital\n   Role: Protagonist\n   Internal Conflicts: Struggles between her duty as a nurse (to save lives) and her personal mission; guilt over abandoning her family; fear of vulnerability.\n   External Conflicts: The physical journey across continents, closed borders, time pressure of the eclipse, and her sister's resentment.\n   Character Arc: From a closed-off, pragmatic nurse who avoids emotional risks to someone who opens up to her sister and daughter, learning that love requires taking leaps of faith.\n\n For Caro Han:\n   Name: Caro Han (her birth name might be Caro Moreau, but she took her husband's name)\n   Age: 38 (younger sister?
