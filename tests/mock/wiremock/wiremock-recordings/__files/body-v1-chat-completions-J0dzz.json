Frost feathers the tall windows; outside, the Polish countryside slides by in silver silence—orchards stripped to their bones, barns the color of old pennies. Isa chooses the table farthest from the samovar, its red lacquer cracked like dried blood. The coffee arrives in a tiny white cup, hotter than grief, and she wraps both hands around it as if it could burn the tremor from her fingers.\n\nShe opens the first envelope—cheap motel stationery scavenged from a drawer in Prague—and writes the line that has stalked her since the voicemail:\n\nI should have told you sooner.  \n\nInk blotches where the pen stalls, a small black bruise on the paper. She pictures Caro beside the farmhouse stove, turning apples in sugar until the whole kitchen smelled like cider and forgiveness. The train sways; coffee slops onto the tablecloth, spreading into a continent-shaped stain.\n\nShe flips to a fresh page, dates it two years ago, the night before the fight:\n\nI should have told you sooner that the fellowship came the same week Ezra broke his arm on the tire swing. You were singing him lullabies made of maple leaves, and I couldn’t bear to trade that lullaby for a one-room flat above a Strasbourg patisserie.\n\nThe pen skids again. A conductor passes, boots ringing the brass runner; he nods at her untouched breakfast plate—black bread, pale butter, a single dill sprig wilting like a green sigh. When he’s gone, she tears the page halfway down, then lets it be. The tear feels honest.\n\nAnother sheet, another year:\n\nI should have told you sooner that I kept the letter under the false bottom of my sketchbook because it smelled like the oil paints we used the summer we painted the children’s bedroom sunset colors. When Daniel found it, I said it was junk mail. I watched the lie land between you like a thrown stone.\n\nThe train lurches. Her cup rolls, clinking against the saucer. She catches it, scalds her thumb. Pain is useful—it keeps memory from swallowing her whole. Through the window, birch trunks flicker past like pages turning too fast.\n\nShe writes faster now, chasing the rhythm of the rails:\n\nI should have told you sooner that when you said “choose,” I heard “abandon,” and I chose wrong.\n\nI should have told you sooner that your laugh still wakes me at 3 a.m. louder than any whistle.\n\nI should have told you sooner that every thrift-store dress I bought after I left had apples in the print, and I hated them all.\n\nThe pile of sealed envelopes grows—cream, robin’s-egg blue, sepia-edged airmail—until the table looks like a small, precarious city. The dining car fills with breakfast smells: smoked fish, burnt sugar, the metallic steam of the espresso machine. Conversations rise in Russian and German, none of them hers.\n\nShe reaches the final blank envelope, thick cream stock she’s hoarded since Florence. Her hand is steadier now. She writes the line, then adds a second:\n\nI should have told you sooner that I’m on my way. If the next train, the next plane, the next breath can carry me to you, I’m coming.\n\nShe licks the seal, tasting paper and regret and the faint sweetness of envelope glue. The train’s speed increases; beyond the window, the horizon blushes gold. Somewhere ahead, the Urals wait like a vertebra of stone across the continent.\n\nIsa gathers the envelopes—the city of unsent words—into her satchel. The weight of fifteen years settles against her hip as she stands. A young waiter clears the cup, the stain, the untouched bread. The dill sprig clings to the plate like a last green promise.\n\nShe steps into the corridor. The scent of coal smoke drifts through the open vestibule, carrying her toward the next carriage, the next decision, the next mile of track unspooling toward the Pacific.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":556,"completion_tokens":895,"total_tokens":1451,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
