Isa hung upside-down in her seat harness, blood roaring in her ears louder than the dying turbine whine. A shard of rotor blade had punched through the cockpit glass; it quivered inches from her cheek, catching the strobing orange of the fire that licked along the fuel slick. Her left shoulder throbbed—dislocated on impact—and every heartbeat felt like a hammer against bone. The concussion fuzzed everything at the edges, turning the smoke into watercolor smears.\n\nShe clawed for the buckle with her good arm, the nylon strap slick with her own blood. Metal groaned overhead; the fuselage had come to rest at a forty-five-degree angle, tail buried in a thicket of spruce. Through the cracked windshield she could see the pregnant teen, unconscious but breathing, still strapped to the stretcher that had somehow stayed locked to the floor. Outside, pine needles hissed as they caught fire.\n\nHer phone buzzed in the breast pocket of her flight suit. It should have been impossible—no signal this deep in the hills—but the screen lit anyway: an encrypted video, sender unknown. Time stamp 14:37. She thumbed it open with a shaking thumb.\n\nThe image was grainy green, night-vision inside a freight container. Luna sat cross-legged, wrists zip-tied, a strip of duct tape over her eyes. Beside her, a smaller figure—Min, Caro’s boy—breathed through a plastic straw jammed into a water bottle. A gloved hand adjusted the angle, and a distorted voice began to sing, the syllables mangled by auto-tune and static: “Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러.”\n\nIsa’s heart stopped mid-beat. The lullaby their mother had sung in two languages, the one no one else alive knew. The voice finished the line and switched to a metallic rasp: “Come back to the river where you buried the truth. Forty-eight hours. Alone.”\n\nThe video ended. The phone blanked to black, reflecting her own soot-streaked face. Somewhere outside the wreck, a fuel tank popped like a gunshot. Isa fumbled for the buckle again, shoulder screaming, every motion sending shards of light across her vision. She had to get out. She had to run.\n\n—\n\nFour thousand miles east, Seoul pressed noon sunlight into the floor-to-ceiling windows of Caro’s penthouse like polished brass. The apartment smelled of cedar shavings and orchids—three dozen rare white Phalaenopsis she had arranged on mirrored trays for a client tour. Each pot was balanced on slim steel stands, the petals so perfect they looked carved from porcelain.\n\nHer phone chimed. 14:37. The same encrypted video. She watched Luna and Min in the green glow, the straw trembling with each shallow breath. The lullaby clawed its way up her throat—she hadn’t heard it in twenty years.\n\nThe orchid she was holding slipped. Ceramic cracked against marble, potting mix blooming across the floor like dark snow. One by one the rest followed, domino-slow: stems snapping, roots exposed, perfume thick as loss.\n\nFrom the hallway came the elevator chime. Footsteps—more than one set—soft-soled shoes on lacquered oak. Caro turned, still clutching the ruined orchid, and saw the men in surgical masks framed against the light. Their eyes were flat, identical behind the white cloth.\n\nThe tallest held up his phone, the same frozen frame of Luna and Min onscreen. “Time’s already moving,” he said in Korean. “The river remembers.”\n\nCaro’s knees buckled. Petals crunched beneath her heels as she sank to the floor, the lullaby echoing in her head louder than the breaking world around her.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":694,"completion_tokens":920,"total_tokens":1614,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
