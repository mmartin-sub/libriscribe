She stares at the churning black water, knowing time is bleeding away for Harper’s baby.\n\nThe terminal breathed cold neon. Rain needled the corrugated roof, each drop a pinprick of light before it slid into the puddles pooling across the concrete. Caro’s sneakers slapped through them, the sound swallowed by the hollow cavern of the hall. She clutched the sketchbook to her chest like a shield; the prepaid phone in her coat pocket thumped against her ribs with every stride.\n\nGate 7 glowed ahead, a rectangle of sickly yellow. Behind it, the ferry’s gangway yawned—metal teeth under sodium lights. She was the last passenger. The crewman at the turnstile glanced at her ticket, then at the sketchbook, brow furrowing as if art were contraband. Caro didn’t stop to explain. She ducked under the half-lowered gate and ran.\n\nWind hit her sideways on the pier, rain tasting of salt and diesel. The ferry’s hull loomed black and barnacled, water slapping its plates with dull thuds. Somewhere inside, engines idled like a patient predator. A second crewman—a woman in a reflective vest—gestured her up the ramp. “Hurry,” she shouted over the wind. “We cast off in two.”\n\nCaro’s lungs burned. She hadn’t run like this since college, since the night she sprinted across the Oval to catch Isa before the Strasbourg cab arrived. Back then she’d carried an apology folded small as a paper crane. She still hadn’t managed to hand it over.\n\nInside, the passenger deck smelled of wet vinyl and instant coffee. Rows of empty seats faced dark windows streaked with rain. Caro chose one near the back, pressed her forehead to the glass. Below, the harbor lights blurred into smears of red and green, as if a child had dragged crayons across black paper.\n\nThe ferry lurched. Water churned white against the hull, then black again. Korea receded, its glow shrinking to a wound on the horizon. Caro opened the sketchbook on her lap. The first page was the strawberry toddler—Harper at two, mouth purple with jam, eyes huge with laughter. Next to it, a study of Isa’s hands the night she packed: fingers clenched around a fellowship letter like she was strangling fate itself.\n\nCaro flipped forward. Blank pages fluttered, mocking her. Fifteen years of silence, and this was all she had to show. She pressed her thumb into the spine until it hurt.\n\nThe prepaid phone buzzed. 4:03 a.m. A text from an unknown Korean number—Samsung Medical Center: Baby delivered. 1.9 kg. Critical but stable. Mother resting. More soon.\n\nShe stared at the words until they dissolved into pixels. Baby delivered—not Harper’s baby, not yet. Just the fact, sterile and small. Caro closed her eyes. Somewhere in the strait, a wave lifted the ferry and let it fall, a slow heartbeat against the dark.\n\nShe whispered to the window, to her own reflection ghosted in the glass: “I’m coming.” The words fogged and vanished. Japan lay ahead, then another ferry, then the bullet train to Seoul. Each mile a stitch trying to close a wound that had been hemorrhaging since Ohio.\n\nRain drummed harder. Caro tucked the sketchbook beneath her seatbelt, clicked it tight. The ferry pushed deeper into the black, engines humming their monotonous lullaby. She did not sleep. She watched the water instead—how it swallowed every trace of light, how it gave nothing back.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":655,"completion_tokens":826,"total_tokens":1481,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
