Isa and Caro argue over past betrayals, but Ji-eun interrupts with a cryptic lullaby fragment, forcing them to prioritize action.\n\nThe hangar doors groaned shut behind them, sealing out the rain and the whine of departing cargo jets. Sodium lamps buzzed overhead, washing the corrugated metal walls in bruise-colored light. A single Cessna 340 sat on the oil-stained concrete like a patient predator, its props still dripping. Between the plane’s nose and a stack of palletized freight, two trestle tables had been pushed together to make an impromptu war room.\n\nKlaus smoothed the map with the heel of his hand. The paper crackled, loud in the hush of the hangar. A red grease-pencil line ran east-west across Europe, kissing coastlines and mountain ranges before diving into Asia. Tiny black triangles marched along it—waypoints, numbered but unnamed.\n\n“Thirty-seven degrees north,” Klaus said, tapping the line. “Your mother used to call it the seam between worlds. Tonight we follow it east, one checkpoint at a time, until the kidnapper tells us to stop.”\n\nCaro leaned in. Rainwater slid from the brim of her cap onto the map, beading on the laminated surface. “Checkpoint one is Mannheim?” Her voice was hoarse from the cold, but steady.\n\n“Rhine kilometer three-sixty-nine,” Ji-eun confirmed. She wore the same leather bomber she’d had since Kosovo, patches faded to gray. In her gloved fingers she held a brushed-steel capsule no larger than a .50-caliber round. “We lifted this off the drone that overflew Hahn an hour ago. Waterproof, pressure-proof. Whoever sent it knew we’d be here.”\n\nIsa stood a pace behind her sister, arms folded so tight her knuckles blanched. The borrowed parka smelled of jet fuel and someone else’s cigarettes. “Mannheim,” she repeated, tasting iron. “You mean the bridge where we—”\n\n“Where we dumped Mom’s ashes, yes.” Caro’s chin lifted. “Don’t say dumped, Isa. She asked us to scatter them there. You were too busy catching your flight to Seoul to remember the exact wording.”\n\nThe words hit like buckshot. Isa felt the sting travel all the way to her wrists. “I had orders,” she said. “Medical rotation at Yongsan. I told you a hundred times—”\n\n“While my brother was bleeding out near Cheorwon,” Caro snapped. “But sure, save the ones who can pay.”\n\nKlaus cleared his throat. “Ladies, we have maybe six hours before the container crosses the Ukrainian border. If you’re going to knife each other, do it after we’re airborne.”\n\nIsa stepped to the table, forcing herself to look at the map instead of Caro’s face. The grease-pencil line passed through places she’d only seen from a helicopter gunship: the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the empty quarter north of Vladivostok. At the edge of the paper someone had written a string of coordinates in Ji-eun’s tidy engineer’s script—49.4875° N, 8.4669° E. Mannheim. A small black star marked the spot.\n\nJi-eun unscrewed the capsule. Inside lay a thumb drive and a slip of rice paper folded into a square. She tweezed the paper out with forceps and laid it flat. Hanja characters glimmered like fish scales under the lamps.\n\nCaro’s breath caught. “That’s Mom’s handwriting.”\n\nJi-eun angled the paper toward them. “I can’t read it,” she admitted. “But the drive’s labeled with the same characters.”\n\nIsa’s throat closed. She recognized the first character—moon—followed by one she’d never bothered to learn. A childhood memory surfaced: their mother humming against her ear, tracing the shapes on her palm so Isa could fall asleep on the Seoul subway. She’d called hanja “self-indulgent grief” once, loud enough for Caro to hear. The fight that followed had lasted a week.\n\nCaro reached for the paper, then stopped, fingers hovering. “Read it,” she said to Isa, voice low. “You always insisted you forgot.”\n\n“I didn’t forget,” Isa muttered. “I just—” She swallowed. “I didn’t want to remember.”\n\nSilence stretched until the lamps seemed to buzz louder. Klaus shifted his weight, boots scuffing concrete.\n\nJi-eun broke it. She spoke the line aloud, syllable by syllable, her pronunciation clipped but careful. “Dal-bit… mul-eul… geu-ri-go…” Moonlight on the water, longing for… something. Isa couldn’t parse the last measure. The rice paper trembled between Ji-eun’s forceps like a living thing.\n\nCaro’s eyes glistened, but her tone was flat. “She used to sing that when you had night terrors. After Dad died. You’d wake up screaming and she’d rock you, singing about moonlight and the river, telling you the dead could still hear us if we spoke their names.”\n\nIsa felt the hangar tilt. The concrete seemed to ripple under her boots. “I was eight,” she said. “I didn’t know what any of it meant.”\n\n“But you knew enough to erase it.” Caro’s voice cracked. “Just like you erased Korea, erased us.”\n\nJi-eun slid the drive into a hardened tablet. The screen woke, casting blue light across their faces. A 1996 Red Cross crest appeared, pixelated but unmistakable. Below it: OPERATION WHITE PINE – RESTRICTED. She angled the tablet so both sisters could see.\n\n“Whatever’s on this,” Ji-eun said, “it ties your mother to a massacre. And the kidnapper wants you to watch it together. Now.”\n\nCaro wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand, smearing mascara across her cheek. “Fine. We watch. Then we go to Mannheim. But understand this, Isa: every step we take, you carry the weight of what you walked away from.”\n\nIsa met her gaze, something hard crystallizing behind her own exhaustion. “I carried plenty, Caro. Just because I didn’t bleed in the same mud doesn’t mean I didn’t bleed.”\n\nKlaus folded the map with military precision, creases sharp enough to cut. “Bleed on your own time,” he said. “Weather window closes in forty minutes. You can kill each other after we’re wheels-up, but right now we move.”\n\nHe snapped off the overhead lamps, plunging them into the dim glow of emergency strips. The Cessna’s door yawned open like a mouth. Isa grabbed her duffel, the weight of the drive and the rice paper suddenly heavier than body armor.\n\nCaro was already climbing the airstair. She paused halfway, looking back. “Moonlight on the water,” she said. “Keep humming it, Isa. Maybe the dead will forgive you.”\n\nIsa followed, rain misting through the open door onto her face, tasting of runway salt and something else—ashes, maybe, or memory. She didn’t answer, but the tune was already threading itself behind her teeth, soft as breath, relentless as the 37th parallel itself.\n\nThe props began to turn.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":687,"completion_tokens":1594,"total_tokens":2281,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
