Her phone buzzes with a Seoul number, delivering news of her mother’s stroke.\n\nThe overhead fluorescents hum like angry hornets, a thin metallic whine that drills into the space behind Isa’s eyes. At 3:07 a.m. the ICU is a cathedral of monitors, each screen pulsing green, amber, red. The teenager on the gurney—sixteen maybe, cheeks still soft with baby fat—jerks against the rails so hard the bed rattles. Froth pinked with blood pearls at his lips.\n\n“Sixty milligrams etomidate, push!” Isa snaps, body angled over the boy, her knuckles whitening around the syringe.\n\nDr. Weber appears at her elbow, hair sticking up like storm-blown wheat. “We’re out of phenobarb. Seizure’s breaking through.”\n\nThe boy’s spine bows, heels drumming the mattress. A monitor screams—heart rate spiking past two-hundred. Sweat blooms across Isa’s scrubs, cold at the small of her back. She slides two fingers under the boy’s tongue to keep him from swallowing it, tastes latex and copper.\n\n“Suction!” she calls.\n\nA nurse slaps the Yankauer tip into her free hand. Isa leans in, suction’s wet hiss loud in the hush, but the froth keeps coming, thicker now. The boy’s eyes roll white, lashes trembling like moth wings.\n\n“Come on, stay with me,” Isa mutters in French, then again in Korean—그래, 버텨—because the accent comforts her more than him.\n\nWeber’s gloved hands dart in, adjusting the oxygen mask. “We need propofol. Bag’s in the Pyxis.”\n\nIsa’s already moving, sneakers squeaking on the waxed floor. The Pyxis drawer unlocks with a mechanical clack; amber vials rattle like glass teeth. She palms two, turns—\n\nHer phone vibrates against her hip, a low buzz swallowed by the alarms. The caller ID glows blue: +82-2-2072-…. Seoul. The code claws at her lungs worse than the etomidate burn.\n\nShe thumbs Ignore, shoves the vials toward Weber. “Ten milligrams per kilo.”\n\nThey push the milky drug. The boy’s convulsions ebb, limbs settling like tide-washed kelp. Heart rate slides down the screen: one-ninety, one-eighty. For a moment the only sound is ventilator sighs, mechanical waves.\n\nIsa’s phone buzzes again, insistent. She steps back, peels off a glove sticky with saliva. “Moreau,” she answers, clipped.\n\n“Isa-sshi?” The voice is a nurse from Seoul National University Hospital, syllables clipped by exhaustion. “Your mother—stroke, massive. Left MCA. She’s asking for you. You need to come.”\n\nThe floor tilts. Isa grips the gurney rail; metal bites into her palm. “Prognosis?”\n\n“Uncertain. The—” Static eats the rest. When the line clears, the nurse is saying “—hours, maybe less.”\n\nOverhead, a new alarm shrills—oxygen saturation dropping. Weber meets her eyes: We’re not done here. The teenager exhales a wet rattle.\n\nIsa pockets the phone, guilt flaring hotter than the sodium lights. “Increase PEEP to eight,” she orders, voice steadying. “Let’s re-tape that tube.”\n\nBut her mind is already on a night-flight across continents, on the smell of her mother’s ink-stained maps, on the way Mom used to tap a red circle and whisper, “When the moon turns, come find me.”\n\nThe boy’s chest rises, falls, rises. Green numbers climb. For now, he breathes.\n\nIsa strips off her second glove, yanks a fresh one on. “I need twenty minutes,” she tells Weber. “Then I have to go.”\n\nWeber nods once, the kind of nod that says understood, and also, hurry.\n\nIsa steps into the corridor. The fluorescents follow her like accusatory stars. Behind the sliding doors, the boy’s seizures quiet, but inside her chest another tremor begins, gaining force with every heartbeat toward the inevitable leaving.\n\nShe speed-walks to the locker room, already calculating: forged note, Lila’s chicken bribe, the 05:55 Lufthansa connection via Frankfurt. The half-map waits in the envelope taped inside her locker.\n\nFootsteps echo—hers, then someone else’s—merging like two rivers racing for the same dark sea.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":614,"completion_tokens":1005,"total_tokens":1619,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
