She is on her knees, shoulder out of socket, helmet cracked like an eggshell. Smoke coils between the trunks, bitter with aviation fuel and scorched aluminum. Somewhere behind her, the co-pilot is screaming, but the sound is underwater, distant. Her left ear rings; her right ear hears only the soft electronic chime of an incoming Signal message.\n\nThe screen lights up with the same blue-white glow that once guided their childhood flashlight tag through the bamboo groves of Yongin. A thumbnail: a freight container, interior lit by a single LED strip. She taps it, hands shaking.\n\nThe video opens to Luna on the left, Min on the right. Both blindfolded in gray duct tape. Both wrists zip-tied to a metal pipe running overhead. A clear drinking straw has been taped into each of their mouths like obscene snorkels. Their chests rise and fall in shallow, panicked beats, fogging the straws with condensation.\n\nA voice, genderless, flattened through a cheap filter, recites the sentence that once lulled them to sleep.  \n“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러.”  \nFrench first, Korean second. The cadence is exact, down to the half-second pause their mother always took between languages.\n\nThen the voice hardens: “Return to the river where you buried the truth. You have until the moon turns its face.”\n\nThe clip ends. The forest wind rushes back in, carrying the smell of pine sap and burning rubber.\n\nIsa doesn’t scream. She simply stops breathing for five full seconds, eyes fixed on the black playback triangle, until the screen dims and reflects her own soot-streaked face. She feels the dislocated shoulder throb in its socket, but the pain is a postcard from another country. Her mind is already moving—measuring distances, calculating borders, hearing the echo of a summer night twelve years ago when three sisters swore an oath beneath dragonfly wings and neon water.\n\nShe pockets the phone, staggers to her feet, and starts limping downhill toward the nearest logging road. Every step drags a memory behind it like a parachute.\n\n—\n\nGangnam-gu, Seoul  \nCaro sets the last dendrobium into a crystal cylinder when the phone on the marble counter illuminates. The penthouse is all glass and winter light; the Han River glitters twenty-seven floors below like a cracked mirror. A string quartet rehearses softly on the built-in speakers—Debussy, because orchids like impressionism, her housekeeper once joked.\n\nShe sees the same thumbnail, same glow. Her manicured thumb hesitates over it, the oval nail catching a prism of reflected sun. Then she taps.\n\nThe video plays. Min’s small face is turned toward the lens, freckles stark against the gray tape. His straw twitches with every terrified gasp. Luna is beside him, older, paler, but Caro recognizes the birthmark under the blindfold’s edge—the faint crescent that always reminded her of a rice grain.\n\nThe lullaby line curls out of the phone’s speaker like a phantom ribbon.  \n“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러.”\n\nCaro’s knees unlock. The orchid tray tilts, slides, crashes in a porcelain avalanche that sends water cascading across the heated marble. A single purple blossom lands upside down, stamens trembling like antennae.\n\n“Return to the river where you buried the truth.”\n\nThe voice is a scalpel now, peeling back years of careful lacquer. Caro sees the river—not the Han gliding below, but the narrow, algae-threaded stream behind their grandmother’s house. She hears the shovel bite wet earth, the hush of three voices making a secret permanent.\n\nThe screen goes black. The Debussy continues, oblivious.\n\nCaro’s hand hovers above the shattered orchids. A bead of blood pearls where a ceramic shard has sliced her index finger. She watches it fall—red on white, like the flag of a country that no longer exists.\n\nWithout wiping her hand, she crosses to the floor-to-ceiling window. In the mirrored glass, her reflection is cut in half by the city skyline. She lifts the phone again, types a single word to Isa—coordinates only, no greeting—and hits send.\n\nThe distance between them was never an ocean. It was a grave.\n\nThe elevator dings softly in the hallway, ready.\n\nEnd of Scene 4","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":665,"completion_tokens":1043,"total_tokens":1708,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
