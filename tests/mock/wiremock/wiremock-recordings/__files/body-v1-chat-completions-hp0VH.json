The bomb deactivates with a hiss; the container doors grind open, revealing Min and Luna still bound.\n\nThe control room smells of hot circuitry and old fear. A single fluorescent tube stutters overhead, painting the lever in sickly pulses of white. Isa’s palm hovers an inch above the worn plastic; the edges are scratched, as if every previous choice had clawed at it.\n\nCaro’s fingers slide over Isa’s—warm, steady, the pulse in her wrist hammering like a trapped sparrow. Their knuckles touch, skin chafing from the cold outside. No words now; the room is too small for speeches. Isa feels the tremor travel from Caro into her own bones until the lever itself seems to breathe.\n\nThe kidnapper’s voice drifts back from the corridor, a murmured stanza of the lullaby, thin as smoke. “피는 물보다 진하다…” Blood is thicker than water. The rest hangs unspoken.\n\nIsa’s throat tastes of iron. Luna’s earlier whisper—Do what you couldn’t do before—echoes behind her ribs louder than any explosion. She thinks of the 1996 report: the blacked-out names, the signatures her mother forged, the villages quietly erased from maps. She thinks of Luna and Min wired to a plate no bigger than a cafeteria tray.\n\nCaro presses down first. The lever gives a millimeter with a reluctant click, as though it, too, has a conscience. Isa adds her weight. The mechanism sinks the rest of the way.\n\nA soft pneumatic hiss—unexpectedly gentle. Not the roar of detonation but the sigh of a secret exhaled. The laptop screen flickers: UPLOAD 100%. Then the countdown on the pressure plate freezes at 00:00:02 and winks out, letters dissolving into black.\n\nFor a moment no one moves. Isa’s heartbeat is the loudest thing in the universe. Then the magnetic locks on the container doors clunk open, the sound traveling through the metal like a tolling bell.\n\nThey run. Boots skid on frost-slick linoleum, past the gutted radio racks and dangling fiber-optic veins. The corridor tilts downward; every footfall lands heavier than the last. Isa reaches the container first and grips the handle, cold enough to scald. She hauls. The hinges scream, and daylight knifes in—steel-gray dawn, river-smell of snow and rust.\n\nInside, Luna and Min sit back-to-back on the bomb crate, wrists zip-tied, silver tape across their mouths. Min’s glasses are cracked but intact; Luna’s eyes are huge, reflecting the burning sky behind them. The pressure plate between their sneakers is dark, harmless, a plastic square of surrendered power.\n\nIsa drops to her knees. The tape comes off Luna’s mouth in one rip; the sound is sharper than the bomb would have been. Luna’s first breath is half-sob, half-laugh. “Took you long enough,” she whispers, then burrows her face into Isa’s shoulder.\n\nCaro saws through Min’s restraints with a multitool blade that shakes only slightly. When the last cuff parts, Min lunges forward, arms around Caro’s neck, a muffled “eonni” muffled against Caro’s parka. Caro holds him so tightly her own tears freeze on his hair.\n\nBehind them, the listening post groans. A tongue of orange fire licks out of the control-room doorway—transformers popping like distant gunshots. The lullaby that played on a loop is now only crackling vinyl and melting circuitry.\n\nIsa rises, Luna clinging to her side, and steps out onto the snow. The river waits below, a gray ribbon frozen to silence. Footprints already mar the surface—escape routes drawn by moonlight and panic. She and Caro exchange a glance: no more hiding behind neutrality, no more erasures.\n\nTogether they lift the children. Luna’s weight is slight but real; Min’s heavier, trusting. Their boots crunch across the frost. Smoke billows overhead, carrying the last syllables of the lullaby into the low clouds. Ash drifts like dark snow.\n\nAt the riverbank, Isa hesitates. The ice creaks, uncertain. Caro nudges her. “We go together,” she says, voice hoarse. “Same weight, same risk.”\n\nThey step onto the Tumen. The river accepts them without a sound, carrying their reflections—four figures stitched by dawnlight—across the border that was never more than a line someone drew on thawing water.\n\nBehind, the listening post collapses in on itself, a final cough of sparks. Ahead, the far bank waits, blank and unwritten.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":663,"completion_tokens":1012,"total_tokens":1675,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
