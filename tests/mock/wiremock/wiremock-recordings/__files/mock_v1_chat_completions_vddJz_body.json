Isa tastes all of it while she claws across the shredded cockpit, left arm dangling like a snapped cable. Her shoulder had popped on impact; every heartbeat shoves the ball of the joint farther out of its socket, but the pain is a distant radio station compared to the hiss of leaking avgas.\n\n“Klaus.” Voice cracked, not hers—too close to the scream she swallowed when the tail rotor disintegrated. She finds the pilot slumped against the cyclic, helmet caved on the left. Blood channels down his cheek, mixing with rain that drips through the ragged hole where the windshield used to be.\n\nShe wedges her right arm under his armpit, fingers slipping on the Nomex. The chopper groans—aluminum ribs protesting like a dying animal. Better to drag them both out now than wait for the fire to decide their exit strategy. She plants her boots on the buckled instrument panel, knees trembling, and pulls.\n\nSomething tears in her shoulder—hot copper wire through muscle—but Klaus slides six inches closer to the doorframe. Another heave. The world tilts, concussion ringing church bells between her ears, but she keeps the rhythm: inhale, brace, drag. Each exhale steams in the frigid air before the rain erases it.\n\nFuel pools under the belly, rainbow slicks swirling over pine needles. One spark and they’ll be barbecue in dress blues. She tastes fuel on her tongue—thin, chemical—and forces herself to move faster. Another yard. Klaus’s boot snags on the doorframe; she kicks it free, then rolls them both into the underbrush.\n\nThe helicopter sighs, metal cooling fast. Smoke curls into the dripping canopy like incense gone wrong. Isa collapses chest-first onto sodden leaves, shoulder screaming, breath sawing. Rain needles her scalp, washing soot into her eyes.\n\nShe checks Klaus—pulse steady, skull fracture probable. No exit wound. Good. Then she wills herself upright.\n\nThat’s when she sees it, half-buried under a smoldering blue spruce: a jagged shard of metal no bigger than a dinner plate, edges still glowing. Cyrillic lettering stamped along the inner curve, the paint scorched but readable. Isa’s throat closes.\n\nShe knows the script from field hospitals outside Grozny, from the crates the rebels never bothered to relabel. Not some stray MANPAD from the desert. This came east—deliberate, tracked. Someone wanted them down.\n\nHer phone buzzes against her hip. 14:37. Unknown caller. The screen shows a thumbnail: Luna blindfolded, wrists zip-tied, breathing through a plastic straw. A distorted voice loops three seconds of childhood French-Korean lullaby, then cuts to static.\n\nIsa’s hand tightens on the shard, Cyrillic letters branding her palm. Cold rain drums on the metal like morse code.\n\nBehind her, Klaus moans—soft, almost apologetic. She shoves the shard into her pocket, wipes blood off her lip, and starts the countdown in her head.\n\nFive minutes to find signal. Ten to reach Ramstein med-evac. Then the river. Always the river.\n\nShe braces her good arm under Klaus’s shoulders and hauls him deeper into the forest, boots squelching, rain washing the crash site into a watercolor blur. Somewhere ahead, a logging road, a radio, a way back to the coordinates buried under decades of silence.\n\nThe lullaby keeps playing in her skull—off-tempo, vowels stretched like taffy. Isa clenches her teeth and walks faster, shoulder grinding, the Black Forest closing in like a green fist.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":581,"completion_tokens":837,"total_tokens":1418,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
