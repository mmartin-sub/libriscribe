At 4:20 a.m. the window facing east turns from ink to smoke; Seoul’s skyline emerges in pencil strokes of rooflines and neon ghosts.\n\nIsa sits opposite, knees drawn to chest, hospital blanket draped like a failed parachute around her shoulders. She watches Caro balance the open book on her lap the way other people balance infants. Nothing has been added to the pages since the fellowship rejection fifteen years ago; the smell of graphite and dried fixative still clings, faint as guilt.\n\n“I kept writing to you,” Isa says, voice rough from jet lag and crying. “Every week of Harper’s pregnancy. Forty-three letters. I have them in my carry-on, still stamped but never mailed.”\n\nCaro’s fingers stop petting the paper. “Where?”\n\n“Under the baby’s blanket. The one with the tiny yellow giraffes.” Isa gives a sideways smile that collapses. “I thought if I brought them here, maybe I could finally let them go.”\n\nA monitor down the hall beeps in triplets—steady, then faster, then steady again. Both sisters listen until the rhythm evens out.\n\nCaro flips to the next blank spread. The paper is so pristine it seems to glow. “I stopped painting the day the fellowship letter came addressed to you,” she says. “Tore the canvas off the stretchers, folded it small enough to fit in the trash chute. I told myself art was a luxury I could no longer afford.”\n\nIsa’s bare toes curl against the vinyl floor. “You were the one who deserved it.”\n\n“No.” The word lands flat. “I was the one who assumed I deserved it. You were the one who got on the plane.” Caro’s laugh is a dry leaf. “I stayed and waited for someone to notice my tantrum. No one did.”\n\nShe reaches for a pen—an old Micron 05, cap chewed, ink probably dried—then sets it down again. The pen rolls toward Isa, stopping against the ridge of the blanket.\n\nOutside, the first subway of morning rumbles somewhere beneath them; the window vibrates, a faint tremor through glass. Inside, silence stretches so thin Caro can hear the blood in her ears.\n\nIsa nudges the pen back with her foot. “Tell me what you would have painted.”\n\nCaro’s gaze drifts to the gray rectangle of dawn, the city’s edges sharpening like a blade being honed. “A self-portrait,” she says. “But the face kept sliding off. I’d start with the eyes—your eyes, actually—and end up with nothing but orbit and shadow. After a while I convinced myself that nothing was more honest than a blank canvas.”\n\nShe tears the edge of the blank page—just a nick, a paper cut of sound—then smooths it flat again. The imperfection glints under the light.\n\nIsa pulls the blanket tighter. “In the letters I apologized for taking Siberia. I apologized for not being there when Mom died. I apologized for the babies I delivered who lived while the one between us never did. I kept writing because I didn’t know how to stop.”\n\nCaro’s shoulders fold inward, a slow collapse. “I never let myself read past the return address. I’d see your handwriting—those looping Korean vowels you never quite mastered—and I’d put the envelope in the drawer with the broken pencils.”\n\nA nurse passes the doorway, rubber soles squeaking, then gone. The hush returns, heavier now, as if the room itself is holding breath.\n\nCaro lifts the Micron, uncaps it. Black ink beads, miraculously alive. She hovers the tip above the paper until a single dot forms—small, perfect, trembling.\n\nIsa shifts closer, knees touching Caro’s across the narrow aisle. “Start with the orbit,” she says softly. “The rest can wait.”\n\nCaro presses a second dot, then a quick arc between them. Two dots and a line—the simplest constellation, the beginning of an eye. Her hand shakes so violently the line wavers, but it holds.\n\nIsa reaches into the baby’s blanket, pulls out the rubber-banded stack of letters, and sets them on the seat between them like an offering. The envelopes are worn, edges feathered, each one addressed but never claimed.\n\nCaro glances at the top letter—her own name in Isa’s uneven penmanship—then back at the two dots on the page. She adds a third, higher, tentative. A tear slips off her cheek and lands beside it, spreading gray tendrils through the paper’s tooth.\n\n“Latitude thirty-seven,” Isa whispers, reading from the back of an envelope. “That’s where the Amur River bends. I wrote to you from there, ice groaning under the train. I said if you ever forgave me, the river would thaw.”\n\nCaro’s next stroke is steadier. A faint horizon begins to form—just a whisper of graphiteless ink, but visible. She does not look up. “The river thawed,” she says, “but I stayed frozen.”\n\nIsa places her bare foot over Caro’s cold one, skin to skin. “Then let’s melt together. One sentence at a time.”\n\nCaro adds another dot—tear-blurred, but deliberate—completing the suggestion of an iris. The page is no longer blank; it is wet, imperfect, alive.\n\nIn the hallway, the baby’s monitor sings a single, steady note. Dawn slips another degree brighter, gilding the window frame. Caro caps the pen, sets it down, and rests her palm atop the stack of letters. Beneath her hand the paper feels warm, as if all those unsent words have been waiting to burn.\n\nShe lifts the first envelope, thumb brushing the seal. “Read it to me?”\n\nIsa exhales, a small white cloud in the air-conditioning. “Only if you keep drawing while I do.”\n\nCaro reopens the sketchbook, turns to a fresh page. Isa slips a finger under the flap. The paper gives with a soft sigh.\n\nOutside, Seoul’s first winter sun climbs just high enough to strike the glass, scattering pale gold across the two sisters, the open envelopes, the nascent line that is beginning—at last—to grow.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":636,"completion_tokens":1417,"total_tokens":2053,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
