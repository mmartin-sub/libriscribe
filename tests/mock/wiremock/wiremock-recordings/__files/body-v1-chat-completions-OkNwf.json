Isa braces a boot against a red web net and leans into the slipstream, gloved fingers riding the pulse at the teenager’s ankle. It flutters once—twice—then steadies.\n\n“Pressure’s dropping, Doc,” Jodie shouts over the rotor roar, one hand squeezing the blood-pressure bulb while the other pins the chart to her thigh.\n\n“Give me sixty of ketamine, push,” Isa answers without looking up. Her voice is the same note she’s used for every casualty in every war zone for the last seven years: low, flat, impossible to disobey.  \n\nThe pregnant girl—fifteen, maybe sixteen—lies strapped to a NATO litter, knees splayed, a crimson pad blooming beneath her. Sweat beads on her upper lip despite the January cold that turns every breath into frost. Her eyes roll white beneath half-closed lids, the lashes sticky with dust and tears.\n\nIsa slides an ultrasound probe across the girl’s bare belly. The screen is a snowstorm of static, but she catches the flicker of a fetal heart at one-forty. Good. Still fighting.\n\n“Contractions every four minutes,” Erik calls from the head of the litter. He’s Norwegian, cheeks wind-burned, headset askew. “Bleeding’s arterial—look at that spurt.”\n\n“Clamp it or pack it. Jodie, another liter of O-neg wide open. Erik, prep the rapid infuser.”\n\nHer own pulse feels distant, a metronome keeping time with the rotor thud. She’s beyond tired; she’s hollowed out and sanded smooth, the way driftwood gets after too many tides. But the body on the stretcher needs the version of her that never sleeps, so she stays in that narrow band of focus where nothing exists except vitals and verbs.\n\nThe Black Forest scrolls beneath them like black-green carpet, fir tops whipping past in stroboscopic flashes of moonlit silver. A patch of snow on a ridgeline glints like broken glass. Somewhere down there are villages and ski lifts and people who have never smelled cordite or birthing blood.\n\nThe girl whimpers. Isa bends close enough to taste the copper on the air. “Hey, small warrior. Stay with me.” Arabic, soft, almost a lullaby. “Dors, mon trésor.” The phrase slips out before she can stop it—then she clamps down, switches back to English. “You’re almost safe.”\n\n“Doc, tail rotor’s running hot,” the pilot crackles through the headset. “Ten minutes to Ramstein.”\n\n“Copy. Ten minutes,” Isa replies, but her mind is already triaging those six hundred seconds: pack the uterus, splint the pelvis, keep the airway open, keep the baby on the monitor. She’s done more in less.\n\nA vibration she can’t name ripples through the deck plates, followed by a high metallic whine. Erik’s head jerks toward the rear. “Was that—”\n\nThe helicopter bucks, tail sliding left. The litter skids sideways; the IV line snaps taut. Alarms shriek as the g-forces slam Isa against the bulkhead. For a heartbeat, everything tilts: the girl’s pale face, the forest spinning below like a roulette wheel, Jodie’s mouth open in a silent shout.\n\nIsa’s last coherent thought before the world fragments is absurdly clinical—Note to self: check shoulder for dislocation after impact—then the night rushes in, rotors howling, metal screaming, and the smell of aviation fuel floods the cabin like a promise already broken.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":593,"completion_tokens":821,"total_tokens":1414,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
