The chapter is titled \"The Call\" and has a specific summary provided.\n\nI need to create exactly 5 scenes for this chapter following very specific formatting requirements. Each scene needs: number, summary (1-2 sentences), characters, setting, goal, and emotional beat. The format must use Markdown bullet points exactly as shown in the query.\n\nLooking at the book description and chapter summary, I see this is about Caro receiving a call about her niece Harper's emergency childbirth in Seoul. Key elements include:\n- Caro getting the call at 4:12am in Seoul\n- Harper is 33 weeks pregnant, needs emergency C-section\n- Isa (Caro's sister) is unreachable on the Trans-Siberian train\n- Caro has to figure out how to contact Isa\n- Flashbacks to the night 15 years ago when their relationship broke\n- Caro takes an old sketchbook with her\n- She boards a ferry to Fukuoka at the end\n\nI'll need to structure 5 scenes that cover:\n1. The initial phone call and shock\n2. Caro's frantic preparations\n3. A flashback to the pivotal past moment\n4. Caro realizing she can't contact Isa\n5. Her departure on the ferry\n\nFor characters, the main ones in this chapter are:\n- Caro (protagonist of this chapter)\n- Harper (mentioned, not present)\n- Isa (mentioned, not present)\n- Samsung Medical Center nurse (briefly)\n- Possibly flashbacks to younger versions of Caro/Isa\n\nSettings will shift between:\n- Caro's Seoul apartment\n- Flashback to Ohio studio/apartment\n- Ferry terminal\n\nEmotional beats should capture:\n- Shock/panic\n- Frantic urgency\n- Guilt/regret\n- Dread\n- Resigned determination\n\nI'll make sure each scene flows naturally to the next, showing Caro's emotional journey from shock to action. The flashback scene needs to feel organic, triggered by something in the present action (like seeing the sketchbook). \n\nImportant to maintain US-English throughout and follow the exact bullet point format specified. No extra commentary - just the 5 scenes in clean Markdown. I'll count carefully to ensure exactly 5 scenes with all required elements.\n</think>\n\nScene 1:  \n* Summary: At 4:12 a.m. in her Seoul apartment, Caro jolts awake to a call from Samsung Medical Center informing her that her niece Harper is in sudden labor at 33 weeks and requires immediate next-of-kin consent for an emergency C-section. She stumbles to answer, barefoot on cold tile, her mind still fogged by sleep as the nurse’s urgent Korean cuts through the silence.  \n* Characters: Caro, Samsung Medical Center Nurse (voice only)  \n* Setting: Caro’s dimly lit Seoul apartment kitchen, pre-dawn light barely filtering through rain-streaked windows  \n* Goal: Establish the inciting incident and Caro’s immediate visceral reaction to the crisis  \n* Emotional Beat: Shock and paralyzing dread  \n\nScene 2:  \n* Summary: Caro frantically searches her apartment for Isa’s current contact details, realizing Isa’s phone number is outdated and her sister remains unreachable due to being aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway between Berlin and Russia. She recalls Harper’s secret move to Seoul for an art internship but never told Isa, flooding her with guilt over the fractured family ties.  \n* Characters: Caro  \n* Setting: Caro’s cluttered Seoul apartment—overturned address book, abandoned laptop, scattered art supplies  \n* Goal: Reveal Caro’s isolation and the logistical/emotional barrier of contacting Isa  \n* Emotional Beat: Panicked guilt and self-recrimination  \n\nScene 3:  \n* Summary: Triggered by finding Harper’s childhood portrait in her sketchbook, Caro flashes back to the Ohio studio fifteen years earlier, where a younger Isa tearfully accepted a prestigious Strasbourg fellowship while Caro silently shattered inside, refusing to beg her to stay. The memory crystallizes the moment their sisterhood fractured over unspoken resentment.  \n* Characters: Young Caro, Young Isa (flashback)  \n* Setting: Flashback to a sun-drenched, paint-splattered shared art studio in Columbus, Ohio (2010)  \n* Goal: Expose the root cause of the sisters’ estrangement through a pivotal past confrontation  \n* Emotional Beat: Numb devastation and lingering betrayal  \n\nScene 4:  \n* Summary: Back in the present, Caro hastily packs a sketchbook—its pages filled with Harper’s childhood drawings—as if it could serve as both passport and apology. She scribbles Harper’s hospital details on a napkin, her hands shaking as she acknowledges she must shoulder the blame for Harper’s secrecy and the years of silence alone.  \n* Characters: Caro  \n* Setting: Caro’s Seoul apartment bedroom, pre-dawn gloom deepening as she stuffs the sketchbook into a worn tote bag  \n* Goal: Show Caro’s attempt to arm herself with emotional artifacts for the confrontation ahead  \n* Emotional Beat: Resigned determination mixed with crushing responsibility  \n\nScene 5:  \n* Summary: Caro races through the deserted Beonyeongdo Ferry Terminal in Busan, boarding the overnight ferry to Fukuoka with only her sketchbook, a prepaid phone, and the suffocating conviction that every broken bond since Ohio stems from her own failures. She stares at the churning black water, knowing time is bleeding away for Harper’s baby.  \n* Characters: Caro, Ferry Crew Member (background)  \n* Setting: Rain-lashed Beonyeongdo Ferry Terminal at 3:47 a.m., neon lights reflecting on wet concrete  \n* Goal: Propel Caro into her physical journey while cementing her internal burden of guilt  \n* Emotional Beat: Hollow resolve and desperate urgency","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1455,"completion_tokens":1260,"total_tokens":2715}}
