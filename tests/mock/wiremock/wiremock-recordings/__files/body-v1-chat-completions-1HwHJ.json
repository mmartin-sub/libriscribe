Birth-country, career, and continents have split them since their double wedding, yet the ache of separation runs deeper than miles. When Isa’s helicopter crashes in the Black Forest and Caro’s son vanishes from a Seoul subway platform on the same day, the sisters receive an identical, cryptic text: “The star that binds you also breaks you. Meet where time cradles the river.” \\n\\nWith their daughters as unlikely companions—Isa’s fearless eleven-year-old Luna and Caro’s tech-savvy nine-year-old Hana—the mothers begin converging journeys. From triage tents to neon-lit arcades, from Rhine barges to bullet trains, they chase clues encoded in childhood lullabies and half-remembered dreams. Each mile strips away old resentments: Isa’s guilt over abandoning family for duty, Caro’s quiet fury at being left behind. Their path arcs along the 37th meridian, a scar across the globe that mirrors the scar tissue in their hearts. At the nexus point where the Rhine meets the Neckar, under the shadow of an ancient bridge, the sisters must decide whether reunion is merely an arrival—or an act of creation.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":360,"total_tokens":550,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
