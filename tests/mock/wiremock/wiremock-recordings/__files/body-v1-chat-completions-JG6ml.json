Simon stands at the table under the hanging lamp, the sketchbook open to a page where a folded letter flutters like a trapped moth. His knuckles are white around a mason jar—empty except for the last amber ring of cider.  \n\nCaro steps in from the porch, snow on her hair, a basket of windfall apples thudding to the floor when she sees him.  \n\n“Those are private.” Her voice slices the room, thin and sharp.  \n\nSimon doesn’t look up. “Strasbourg? A fellowship?” He rattles the jar, the glass against the oak sounding like a cracked bell. “You applied for this?”  \n\nCaro’s boots leave wet half-moons on the floorboards. “It’s Isa’s sketchbook. Put it down.”  \n\nHe flips the letter over, the university crest catching the lamplight. “It’s addressed to you. Not her. You’d leave your own family?”  \n\nThe last word lands like a thrown stone; somewhere in the house a child coughs in sleep and settles again. Caro’s shoulders lift, then drop.  \n\n“Simon—”  \n\n“Don’t.” He finally meets her eyes. In the warm kitchen, his look is winter. “The kids wake up asking where you are when you’re just out in the orchard. What happens when you’re across an ocean?”  \n\nCaro crouches to gather apples that rolled under the bench. The bruised ones smell sharp, almost winey. “It’s two semesters. Letters, visits. I thought we could manage—”  \n\n“Manage.” He repeats the word like he’s tasting rot. “While I patch the roof and homeschool Jonah because the district keeps cutting days, you thought you could manage?”  \n\nShe stands, arms full of fruit, and sets them on the counter without meeting his gaze. “I thought I could matter.” The sentence barely makes it past her throat.  \n\nSimon flips the sketchbook shut. The sound is small, final. Paper against paper. “Matter here, Caro. Not in some studio where you paint pictures of people you’ll never see again.”  \n\nA log pops in the stove, sparks against the iron door. Caro rubs a thumb over an apple’s broken skin; juice beads like blood. “You don’t get to decide what counts.”  \n\nHe lifts the letter between two fingers and holds it to the lamp. The parchment glows, almost translucent. “Burn it or I will.”  \n\nCaro snatches it so fast the paper tears, a soft ripping that seems louder than the storm outside. She backs toward the hallway, clutching the halves to her chest.  \n\nSimon’s voice drops. “Tell your sister to keep her damn plans away from this house.”  \n\nThe kitchen door creaks as Isa appears on the threshold, breath white in the cold draft. Snowflakes melt on her eyelashes. She sees the torn letter, Simon’s jar, Caro’s stricken face.  \n\nFor one heartbeat the three of them are framed there—lamplight, cedar smoke, the smell of winter coming through the open door. Then Caro turns and walks past Isa without a word, the pieces of the fellowship letter crumpling in her fist.  \n\nSimon watches her go, jaw set. The empty jar rolls from his fingers and shatters against the floor, shards sparkling like the first hard frost.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":566,"completion_tokens":777,"total_tokens":1343,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
