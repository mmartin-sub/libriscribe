She scribbles Harper’s hospital details on a napkin, her hands shaking as she acknowledges she must shoulder the blame for Harper’s secrecy and the years of silence alone.\n\nThe bedroom smelled of cold metal and old talc from the radiator. A single streetlamp, filtering through the slats of the half-closed blinds, striped the floorboards with wan yellow bars. Caro knelt at the foot of the bed, fingers fumbling for the switch of the small lamp clamped to the nightstand. When the bulb flared, the room leapt into bruised color: the unmade duvet a storm-dark plum, the wall a faded indigo where Harper’s first charcoal sun had once been taped.\n\nThe closet door sighed open. On the upper shelf, behind a stack of winter sweaters still zipped in plastic, lay the sketchbook wrapped in a dish-towel the color of strawberry pulp. She pulled it down, the towel snagging on a loose nail, and the book dropped into her lap with the soft thud of a small body. The spine was cracked; flecks of gold leaf clung to the title she had lettered in Ohio—Harper, Age 2-5. The word Harper had been retraced so many times the paper was furred like felt.\n\nCaro peeled the towel away. Inside, the first page was a riot of crayon greens and blues: Harper’s attempt at a lake, the water scribbled so hard the wax had crumbled and rolled like beach glass in the gutter. Beneath it, in twelve-year-old Caro’s careful architect’s lettering: Lake Erie, July 2008, day Isa left.\n\nShe flipped faster—page after page of smudged palm prints, a dog with three legs, a purple kite caught in a tree. Every drawing was annotated with Caro’s tidy dates and captions, the record she had kept because Isa hadn’t asked for it, and Harper had been too small to remember. She stopped at a sketch she had done herself: Harper asleep in her Ohio crib, one fist curled under her chin, strawberry jam still on her cheek from breakfast. Caro had shaded the jam until the paper bruised. Around the portrait she had written, For when she forgets she was loved first by us.\n\nThe lamp flickered. Outside, a garbage truck rumbled down the alley, its hydraulic jaws chewing metal. Caro’s own pulse seemed to sync with the grind. She pressed the sketchbook against her sternum, as if the pages’ ragged heart could reset hers.\n\nShe stood, knees popping, and grabbed the worn canvas tote that usually carried onions from Namdaemun market. The sketchbook went in first, then the charger for the prepaid phone, then—because her hands needed something else to do—the tin of peppermints she’d bought the day she arrived in Seoul and never opened. The tin made a hollow clack against the phone. Too loud. She slipped it out again, set it on the nightstand, then stared at it as though it might accuse her of cowardice.\n\nOn the dresser lay a stack of napkins from the bakery downstairs. She yanked one free, the paper tearing at the scalloped edge. Samsung Medical Center—Harper Song—Room 310, NICU pre-consent form C-Sect 0330. Her pen skated over the napkin’s waxed surface; ink feathered like frost. She wrote the surgeon’s name, the extension number, the phrase high-risk preterm in block capitals because anything smaller felt like a lie.\n\nThe pen slipped. A blue comma of ink landed on the inside of her wrist. She stared at it, then scrubbed with the heel of her hand until the skin turned raw. The mark stayed, blooming darker. Evidence.\n\nFrom the living room, the ferry app pinged: boarding in forty-three minutes at terminal 1A.\n\nCaro’s breath snagged. She had promised the doctor she would be there before the spinal block. Seoul to Busan, Busan to Fukuoka, Fukuoka to Seoul again—no flights, only water and rail, because Isa’s phobia was a continent wide and Caro had helped build it. She could already feel the burn of salt air on her cheeks, the sway of the overnight ferry as it edged away from the pier. All those years ago she had waved from the dock at Cleveland, watching Isa’s ferry shrink to a spark on the lake, thinking distance was something you could measure in nautical miles.\n\nShe shouldered the tote. The strap cut into the inked bruise on her wrist. In the mirror above the dresser, her reflection wavered: hair unbrushed, T-shirt on backward—label sticking out like a surrender flag. She reached to turn it right side out, then stopped. Let it stay wrong. Let everything stay wrong until she could make it right in person.\n\nOne last sweep of the room: the bedside clock blinking 4:37, the sweater she’d worn yesterday still draped on the chair like a discarded skin. She hesitated, then snatched the sweater and rolled it into the tote, stuffing it down beside the sketchbook as if warmth could be compressed and carried.\n\nThe hallway light buzzed overhead, moths throwing themselves against the fixture in soft, frantic taps. Caro’s phone vibrated—another call from the hospital. She silenced it without looking, thumb trembling. On the napkin, the ink had finally dried, the numbers fixed like coordinates on a map she hadn’t known she’d been drawing all these years.\n\nShe opened the apartment door. The corridor smelled of kimchi and floor wax and someone’s burnt toast. Her own breath tasted of iron. She stepped across the threshold, tote heavy against her hip, and pulled the door shut behind her. The click sounded final, like a page turning without the option to go back.\n\nDown the stairwell, her footsteps echoed a countdown she couldn’t slow. At the landing, the sketchbook’s corner poked through the canvas, a small tear releasing a wisp of paper—Harper’s lake, perhaps, or the kite. Caro tucked it back in, palm flat against the cover as if swearing an oath. \n\nOutside, the first edge of dawn showed above the Han, a thin line of mercury between black water and blacker sky. She started toward the metro, the napkin crumpled in her fist, the ferry’s horn already sounding across the river like something ancient and hungry calling her name.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":639,"completion_tokens":1384,"total_tokens":2023,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
