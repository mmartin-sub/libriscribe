They have not spoken since their joint wedding dissolved in competing vows: one to the Hippocratic oath, the other to filial duty. The sisters have convinced themselves the distance is purely geographic.\\n\\nThat illusion shatters at 14:37 on a Tuesday. Isa’s med-evac is shot down over the Black Forest; Caro’s son is yanked from a Seoul subway at the exact same minute. A video arrives on both their phones: the children bound and blindfolded inside a freight container, coordinates ticking down seven days. The kidnapper signs off with one line of their childhood lullaby—French and Korean in a single breath—and a demand: “Revisit the river where you buried the truth.”\\n\\nTo secure international transit in hours, not days, the sisters accept clandestine help: a shell-shocked German pilot who owes Isa his life and Caro’s ex-roommate, now a K-pop tour logistics wizard. The chase runs along the 37th parallel east—Rhine, Neckar, Danube, across the steppes to Vladivostok—each checkpoint revealed by solving bilingual fragments of the lullaby they once sang together. Luna, Isa’s eleven-year-old, guides them through dark-web maps; Hana, Caro’s nine-year-old coding prodigy, feeds them real-time CCTV hacks from inside the container.\\n\\nOld resentments surface in hard specifics: Isa’s guilt over dodging Korean conscription law that punished Caro’s brother; Caro’s fury at Isa’s casual dismissal of han—Korean grief that never ends. Yet the same cultural chords that divide them become the code that keeps their children alive.\\n\\nAt the final coordinate—an abandoned Soviet listening post on the Russian-Korean border—the sisters face a literal switch: release the children by uploading a classified wartime atrocity report that will ruin Isa’s reputation and put Caro’s entire family on a Pyongyang watch-list. Or walk away with their names intact and never see the kids again. The choice is no longer metaphor but a cold, mechanical lever.\\n\\nOnly one question remains: is blood thicker than the river of secrets they once poured it into?\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1443,"completion_tokens":590,"total_tokens":2033,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
