Geography and ambition scattered them: Isa accepted a coveted post in a Strasbourg neonatal unit, while Caro followed her husband’s corporate transfer to Seoul and became the reluctant anchor of a foreign life. Years of missed birthdays and unanswered emails calcified into silence. When Isa’s daughter, now pregnant, books a last-minute flight to Seoul to meet Caro’s son—crashing the cousins together for the first time—the sisters are forced onto parallel journeys. Isa boards a trans-Siberian train clutching an envelope of half-written apologies; Caro packs a single suitcase of memories and boards a midnight ferry to Japan to intercept the girl she once rocked to sleep. Along the way, each must confront the myth that distance always means safety and rediscover the heroism of saying “I was wrong.” Their reunion, set against the ticking clock of a premature labor, becomes not just a homecoming, but a rebirth for two families split by pride, healed by story.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":303,"total_tokens":493,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
