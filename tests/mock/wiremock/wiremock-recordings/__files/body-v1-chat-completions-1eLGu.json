Rain streaks the windows in horizontal slashes, the Belarusian countryside a watercolor wash of pine and low sky. Isa’s fingers drum a jittery rhythm on the lacquered table, each tap louder than the last, until the elderly man across from her lowers his newspaper and frowns.\n\nShe gives him a tight smile—sorry, nerves—then goes back to watching the door. The conductor who collects tickets at dawn had a face like a peeled apple, red and creased, and a gold tooth that flashed when he laughed at something on his phone. If he has Wi-Fi, she’ll pay whatever he asks. She’s already down to the emergency euros zipped inside her passport pouch, but panic is louder than frugality.\n\nHe appears at the far end of the car, elbows swinging, epaulettes shining despite the gloom. Isa stands so fast her chair screeches. The newspaper man flinches. One of the overhead bulbs flickers, a stutter of light that makes the conductor look like an old film skipping frames.\n\n“Ma’am.” He pauses beside her, eyebrows raised. “Ticket?”\n\n“Checked at breakfast.” Her voice comes out breathless. “But I need—” She glances left, right, lowers her voice. “I need internet. Just ten minutes.”\n\nHe rubs a thumb over his chin. “The train’s router is overloaded. Everyone wants to stream the match.”\n\nIsa fishes a folded fifty from her pocket, edges soft from handling. She presses it into his palm like contraband. “I don’t care about the match. My kid—” The word still feels borrowed, too bright for the dark space between them. “My kid might be hurt.”\n\nHis gaze flicks to the note, to her face, to the note again. The gold tooth catches the weak light when he exhales. “Come.”\n\nThey step into the narrow vestibule between cars where the floor plates rattle and the wind howls through the coupling. Rain mists her cheeks. The conductor pulls a phone from inside his cap, thumb dancing across a cracked screen. “Hotspot. Five minutes. Then I walk away.”\n\n“Thank you.” The words come out cracked, like thin ice.\n\nSignal bars appear, one, two, then none, then two again. Isa’s hands shake as she opens the voicemail app. The Seoul number blinks. She hits play, presses the phone to her ear.\n\nStatic first. Then a voice—Harper’s?—thin and underwater. “…told you not to come but she’s bleeding, Mom, please—” A metallic clatter. Silence.\n\nThe next bar vanishes. She bites down on a moan.\n\nEmail. She opens the browser, types with stiff thumbs. The inbox loads line by agonizing line. At the top, a message from an address she hasn’t seen in years: caro.marchand@nomail.fr. Subject: Re: forwarding.\n\nHer stomach tilts, nothing to do with the train’s sway.\n\nShe taps. The screen stalls on a spinning wheel. The conductor checks his watch. Rain lashes the windows like thrown gravel.\n\nThe email opens:\n\nTo whoever finds this—  \nFlight 742, gate 17. If the sky holds, I’ll be in Seoul by tomorrow night.  \nTell her I’m not angry anymore.  \nC.\n\nIsa reads it twice, three times. The phone slips, clatters against the wall. The conductor bends to retrieve it, but she’s already sliding down the cold metal, knees folding like paper. Not angry anymore. The phrase flays her. She has fifteen years of apologies curled in an envelope in her cabin, and Caro is already over the Pacific.\n\n“Ma’am?” The conductor’s voice is gentler now. “Your five minutes.”\n\nShe pushes herself upright. “One more thing.” Her thumb hovers over a search bar. She types Harper Kim Seoul hospital, hits enter. The loading bar creeps.\n\nResults bloom: St. Mary’s ER, Itaewon-ro, 2:14 a.m. local time—an article in Korean, thumbnail photo of ambulances under neon. No names. But the timestamp matches the voicemail. Isa’s pulse pounds in her teeth.\n\nThe signal dies. The conductor pockets the phone, tips his cap. “Good luck.” He steps back into the dining car, leaving her alone with the growl of the rails.\n\nShe stands there until the train shrieks around a bend and the vestibule tilts. Her reflection flickers in the rain-streaked glass: hollow cheeks, eyes wide enough to swallow light. Caro is ahead of her, racing toward the same city. Harper is somewhere inside it, maybe bleeding, maybe not. And Isa is suspended between them on a train slicing across Belarus with all her unsent words burning a hole through her coat pocket.\n\nShe presses her forehead to the cold window. Ahead, a signal light blinks red, then green. The train surges. Somewhere past the Urals, she’ll make the choice that Caro already made: to close the distance, to risk the collision.\n\nThe coupling clanks like a closing gate. Isa straightens, wipes her face dry, and starts back through the swaying cars—toward her cabin, toward the envelope fat with years, toward Vladivostok and whatever waits after.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":564,"completion_tokens":1182,"total_tokens":1746,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
