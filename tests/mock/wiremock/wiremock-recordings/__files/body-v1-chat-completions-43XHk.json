She keeps her gaze level, counting steps—seven more to the turnstile, twelve to the kiosk, past the vending machines hawking peach tea and hot soup in cans—because if she stops counting she will start remembering Harper at six, chasing lightning bugs across the orchard, and remembering is the one indulgence she refuses herself today.\n\nTokyo Bay shines too bright, a coin flipped to the sun. White-gloved attendants bow commuters onto the jet-ferry to Kobe; schoolchildren in yellow hats surge around her, their laughter ricocheting off glass walls. Caro shifts the photo to her left hand, the one farthest from her heart, and checks the boarding pass: 11:14 a.m., Car Deck B. The paper flaps like a trapped moth.\n\n“Excuse me, photo-san,” a teenage boy says, apologetic English, pointing at the faded Polaroid. “Your daughter?”\n\nCaro almost answers, “Yes, once.” Instead she smiles the small, economical smile that got her through Harper’s teenage years and Izzy’s silence afterward. “She’s older now.”\n\nThe boy bows again, vanishing into the crowd. The photo stays steady: Harper at three, cheeks apple-round, sitting on Isa’s lap in the farmhouse kitchen with flour in her hair. Both of them laughing so hard their eyes are slits. On the reverse, Caro’s own handwriting, written in a colder season: For when you forget how to come home.\n\nShe moves again, shoulder against the tide. The terminal smells of diesel and frying squid and the metallic bite of early summer heat. At the pay lockers she keys in the combination she still uses for everything—Harper’s birth date, month and year only—and pulls out the slim nylon satchel she packed in the hotel before dawn: passport, cash card, a single change of clothes. She adds the envelope of scanned medical records the Seoul hospital emailed, edges soft from folding and unfolding. Her thumb brushes the word “fracture.” She folds it once more, crease over crease, until the word disappears.\n\nA uniformed woman checks tickets at the ramp. “Family boarding is to the right,” she says in careful English.\n\nCaro hesitates. The right line is shorter, bright with matching T-shirts and grandparents snapping selfies. The other line—mixed passengers, single travelers, people who look like they are running toward or away from something—stretches longer, shadier. She steps left.\n\nThe ramp clangs beneath her. Wind off the bay whips her loose hair into her mouth. She tastes salt and engine grease. Ahead, the ferry’s yawning car deck swallows travelers whole. Somewhere inside, a child is crying; the sound rises and falls with the gulls overhead.\n\nCaro pauses at the threshold. She thumbs the edge of the photo, feels the soft feathering where the emulsion has lifted. Harper’s three-year-old face looks up at her, trusting. The same face bruised and older in the grainy phone video Isa sent at 3 a.m. last night—Harper on a Seoul sidewalk, blood at her hairline, someone shouting in Korean. Caro’s reply had been one word: coming. She has not answered Isa’s barrage of messages since.\n\nA buzzer sounds, two short blasts. The line shuffles forward. Caro draws a breath, tasting diesel and her own heartbeat, and steps onto the ferry. The gangway lifts behind her with a hydraulic sigh that sounds almost human. She does not look back at the terminal windows, does not scan the faces for the impossible silhouette she still half expects to see waving, sketchbook under one arm, apology balanced on her tongue.\n\nInstead she finds a seat on the open deck, windward rail. She sets the satchel between her feet like a loyal dog. The engines thrum awake; water churns white. Tokyo’s skyline slides backward, glass and steel dissolving into heat shimmer. Caro opens her hand. The photo flutters once, then lies still against her palm.\n\nShe closes her fist around it—not tight enough to crease, just enough to remind herself she is still solid, still moving. The ferry rounds the breakwater. The Pacific stretches ahead, flat and unreadable as Isa’s last letter, still unopened in Caro’s coat pocket. She breathes in salt, out anger. Salt, anger. The rhythm steadies her for whatever waits on the other side of the water.\n\nBehind her, gulls wheel and dive, screaming like torn paper. She does not turn.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":546,"completion_tokens":1010,"total_tokens":1556,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
