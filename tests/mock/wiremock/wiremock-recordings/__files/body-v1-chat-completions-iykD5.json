Let me start by understanding the book's description. The story follows estranged sisters Isa and Caro traveling to Seoul to be with Harper in the NICU. They have a lot of unresolved issues from 15 years ago. The novel uses shifting perspectives among the sisters, their husbands, and their grown children. So, right off the bat, Isa and Caro are two main characters. Then their husbands and grown children—Harper and maybe another child? Wait, Harper is Isa's daughter and Caro's niece. The book mentions \"grown children\" plural, so maybe Harper and another child? Or perhaps each sister has a spouse and a child, but Harper is the only mentioned child. Hmm, the user specified 8 main characters. Let me check the query again.\n\nThe user says: \"Told in shifting perspectives—Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children...\" So that's Isa and Caro, their two husbands, and two grown children (Harper and another? Or maybe Harper and the other child is from Caro?). But Harper is Isa's daughter. The book's main characters are Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children. Wait, but how many grown children? Plural. So at least two. Let me parse that again. The sisters' husbands and their grown children—so each sister might have their own grown child? Or perhaps Isa has Harper and another, but the description mentions Harper as the niece. So maybe Caro doesn't have a child. Wait, but the user wants 8 main characters. So if the main characters are Isa, Caro, their husbands (two), and their grown children (Harper and another child—maybe from Caro's husband?), but the book says \"the grown children\" plural. Maybe Isa's daughter Harper and Caro's son? Or perhaps Harper has a sibling? Wait, the book description says Harper's the daughter and niece. So maybe the \"grown children\" refers to Harper and another character. Let me think.\n\nWait, the user says: \"the latitude at which forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes a choice is reached in the fluorescent hush of a Seoul hospital at 3:00 a.m.\" So the story involves multiple perspectives. The eight main characters would include the sisters, their husbands, their two children (Harper and another?), but the book's description mentions \"grown children\" plural. Maybe Harper and someone else, like a sibling or a cousin? Or perhaps the other grown child is from one of the husbands' previous marriages? Alternatively, maybe other family members or friends. The user also mentioned \"each woman carries the accumulated weight of fifteen years of silence, regret, and unspoken betrayal. Their parallel journeys—Isa on the Trans-Siberian and Caro on ferries and budget flights—force them to confront the men they left behind, the art they abandoned, and the moment their shared story cracked.\" So the men they left behind could be their husbands or other partners, but since they have husbands, maybe those are their current spouses? Wait, but the husbands might be among the main characters. Also, the grown children could be Isa's daughter Harper, and Caro's child? Or maybe Caro doesn't have children. The book description isn't clear on that. But the user wants 8 main characters. Let's list them:\n\n1. Isa\n2. Caro\n3. Isa's husband\n4. Caro's husband\n5. Harper (Isa's daughter)\n6. Another child (maybe Caro's son? Or Isa's other child? Or a sibling or friend?)\n7. Eighth character—if the story includes perspectives from the husbands and two grown children, that's 4 (Isa, Caro, two husbands, two children = 6). Then maybe two more supporting characters? Or perhaps Harper has a partner or friend. Alternatively, the user might expect the children to be two, so Harper and another, making 8 total when including both husbands. Wait, the initial book description says the perspectives are Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children. So four perspectives: Isa, Caro, each of their husbands, and the two grown children. That's six. Then two more? Or maybe other characters necessary for the story. But the user says \"8 main characters\". So perhaps each sister has a husband, each has a grown child, and two more characters. But Harper is Isa's daughter. Maybe Caro has a son? Or another character. Alternatively, maybe Harper has a sibling (so Isa has two children) but the book only mentions Harper. Hmm.\n\nBut the user might be okay with Harper and another child from somewhere. Let me proceed. Let's start with Isa and Caro. Then their husbands, their grown children (Harper and another, perhaps Caro's stepchild or a friend?), and maybe two more characters like a doctor in Seoul or someone else. But the problem says \"main characters\" so they should have significant roles. Wait, the book is about the sisters' journey and their past. So perhaps the husbands and the two children are main. That's 2+2+2 = 6. Need two more. Maybe the men they left behind 15 years ago? Like ex-partners or lovers. Alternatively, maybe a sibling or parent. But the book's description doesn't mention that. The example in the description mentions their own husbands. Alternatively, maybe two doctors/nurses in the hospital. Or perhaps one of the husbands has another role.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have meant that the story is told from the perspectives of Isa, Caro, their two husbands, and the two grown children (Harper and another), totaling 6. Then two more? Maybe other family members or friends who are significant. Wait, the book's description says \"the novel braids past and present, Ohio and East Asia, painting and medicine\". So maybe Isa was an artist (painting) and Caro is in medicine? Or vice versa. Let me see.\n\nIsa's journey is on the Trans-Siberian, which goes from Russia to East Asia. Caro's on ferries and budget flights, perhaps starting from the US. The backstory is that they left behind men, art, and medicine. So perhaps Isa left her art career and Caro left her sister. Their fields are painting and medicine, maybe Isa is an artist and Caro is a doctor? That could make sense. The grown children: Harper is Isa's daughter, and maybe Caro's husband's child from a previous marriage, or another child. Alternatively, perhaps Harper's sibling. But the problem says \"the novel braids... their husbands, and the grown children\"—so maybe each sister's spouse and each sister's child. But Caro might not have a child, but the user wants 8 main characters. Hmm. Let me check the user's instruction again. The user says \"Each character's relationships with other characters should create new characters if necessary to complete the story.\" So perhaps creating additional characters beyond the initial ones.\n\nSo, main characters needed: 8. Let's start.\n\n1. Isa (Protagonist)\n2. Caro (Protagonist)\n3. Harper (Isa's daughter, supporting? Or protagonist?)\n4. Isa's husband (maybe Marcus)\n5. Caro's husband (maybe Daniel)\n6. Another grown child (perhaps Caro's child? But book description doesn't mention. Or a grown child that's connected, like Caro's stepson or something. Or maybe a child from one of the husbands' previous relationships.)\n7. Dr. Cho in Seoul, critical to the NICU plot\n8. Maybe an old friend or a sibling from their past, like someone from Ohio who connects to their shared history.\n\nWait, but the user says \"the art they abandoned\" so Isa was an artist? And \"medicine\" could be Caro's field. So perhaps Caro is a doctor, which explains her connection to the NICU. Wait, but Isa's daughter Harper is in the NICU. So Harper is the mother of the premature baby. Wait, the baby is dangerously premature, so Harper is a mother, so she's at least in her 20s or 30s. The book's description says \"the grown children\" which would imply Harper and another child. So maybe Harper and another character, perhaps the sibling of the premature baby's father? Or another child from the other sister? Let me recheck:\n\n\"Harper—Isa’s daughter and Caro’s niece—has delivered a dangerously premature child.\" So Harper is the mother of the baby. So Harper is a mother, so she's an adult. The grown children could be Harper and another character. Wait, maybe the other grown child is the child of Caro? The book doesn't specify that Caro has kids, but perhaps she does. Let me assume that the eight main characters are:\n\n- Isa\n- Caro\n- Marcus (Isa's husband)\n- Daniel (Caro's husband)\n- Harper (Isa's daughter, niece to Caro)\n- Jonah (Harper's brother, Isa's son)\n- Dr. Min-Jae Kim (NICU doctor)\n- Kyung (a nurse in the NICU or a friend)\n\nBut maybe the two husbands and two children are part of the eight. Wait, the user says the story includes the sisters, their husbands, and the grown children. But how many grown children? The baby in NICU is Harper's. If the \"grown children\" are Harper and someone else, perhaps another child of Isa's or Caro's. Alternatively, Caro might have a child. But the book description doesn't mention that. So perhaps I need to create a child for Caro. Let's imagine that. Then that would make two children from each sister: but Harper is Isa's daughter. If Caro has a son, then that's another grown child. Then maybe two more characters from the husbands, and two more? Or perhaps the eight are: Isa, Caro, Marcus (Isa's husband), Daniel (Caro's husband), Harper, Jonah (another child, perhaps Harper's cousin or Caro's child), Dr. Min-Jae Kim, and Nurse Hana. That would make eight. Alternatively, maybe the husbands are two, then two children, and two other characters from Seoul. Let me structure this.\n\nFirst, the two protagonists: Isa and Caro. Their two husbands: Marcus and Daniel. Then two grown children: Harper and Jonah (maybe Harper's sibling or Caro's child). Then two more characters related to the Seoul setting, perhaps a doctor and a nurse. Let me make sure each has a role in the story.\n\nIsa's Profile:\n- Name: Isa\n- Age: Let's say in her 50s, since 15 years have passed since the split. If Harper is her daughter and delivered a baby, Harper is at least 20s, so Isa could be 45-50 when Harper was born. So 15 years since the split, so 15 years after Harper was born? Wait, no. If Harper is delivering a baby now, and the split was 15 years ago, Harper would be in her 20s or 30s. So Isa is in her late 50s or 60s. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the sisters estranged 15 years ago. So if they are now middle-aged, maybe Isa is 45-55. Let's say Isa is 52. Caro could be younger or same age.\n\nPhysical Description: Should be detailed. Isa's clothing style, maybe as an artist, more bohemian? Caro as a medical professional, maybe more conservative.\n\nPersonality Traits: Brave, Resentful, Guilt-ridden, Compassionate, Stubborn. For Caro: Analytical, Guilty, Empathetic, Protective, Dismissive.\n\nBackground: Need to explain how they got estranged. The user's description says they left behind men they left behind, art abandoned, the moment their shared story cracked. So perhaps 15 years ago, there was a betrayal related to Caro leaving Isa behind, maybe a romantic involvement with someone Isa was close to? Or a competition in their careers.\n\nMotivations: Isa wants to reconcile or support her daughter, but also deal with past guilt. Caro might want redemption or to prove she's not the bad one.\n\nRelationships: Isa is mother to Harper, sister to Caro, married to Marcus. Caro is sister to Isa, married to Daniel, perhaps has a child (Jonah?), or maybe not. Wait, the user says \"create new characters if necessary\", so maybe Caro's child is a new character.\n\nLet me outline each character step by step.\n\n1. Isa (Protagonist)\n   - Age: 52\n   - Physical Description: Maybe tall, with graying hair, wears practical clothes but with some artistic flair. Maybe a scarf or something.\n   - Personality: Guilt-ridden, artistic, headstrong, nurturing, secretive.\n   - Backstory: Former artist, estranged from sister, left Ohio for Russia or somewhere. Harper is her daughter.\n   - Motivations: Reach the baby, reconcile with Caro, face her past failures.\n   - Relationships: Mother to Harper, wife to Marcus, sister to Caro.\n   - Role: Protagonist\n   - Internal Conflict: Regret over past choices, guilt about betrayal.\n   - External: The journey on Trans-Siberian, reaching Seoul before baby dies.\n   - Arc: From guilt to forgiveness.\n\n2. Caro (Protagonist)\n   - Age: 49 (slightly younger)\n   - Physical: Maybe shorter, sharp professional appearance, neat. Works in medicine, so maybe a no-nonsense style.\n   - Personality: Analytical, guilt-ridden, perfectionistic, loyal to some, bitter.\n   - Backstory: A doctor, abandoned art, estranged from Isa.\n   - Motivations: Save her niece's baby, make amends, prove her worth.\n   - Relationships: Sister to Isa, married to Daniel, maybe mother to Jonah?\n   - Wait, the book says Isa's daughter is Caro's niece. So Caro doesn't have a child. But the story needs another grown child. Maybe Harper's sibling? Or perhaps someone else. Alternatively, the \"grown children\" could refer to Harper and another character related to Caro. Let me create Jonah as Isa's son, Harper's brother. He could be another perspective. But user said 8 main characters. Let me proceed.\n\n3. Harper (Supporting)\n   - Age: 28 (so Isa was in her late 20s/early 30s when she had her)\n   - Physical: Maybe resembles Isa, but more modern, tired in the present storyline.\n   - Personality: Resilient, Determined, Anxious, Empathetic\n   - Backstory: Isa's daughter, Caro's niece. Premature baby's mother. Relationship with her mother is strained due to the family rift.\n   - Motivations: To have her baby survive, to maintain composure, maybe to reconcile her parents/sister-aunt.\n   - Relationships: Mother to the baby, with her father Marcus? Or Marcus is her stepfather. Wait, Isa's husband is Marcus, so Harper's father could be Marcus, or someone else. If Isa's estranged from Caro, maybe Harper's father is someone from their shared past. But need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps Harper's father is Caro's ex, which could tie into the betrayal. Or maybe the betrayal is that Caro had a relationship with Isa's partner. But need to work that into their backstory.\n\n4. Marcus (Isa's husband)\n   - Age: 55\n   - Physical: Maybe a professor or something, so intellectual look.\n   - Personality: Supportive, Stoic, Rational, Has a hidden temper.\n   - Backstory: He's a medical researcher, which ties into medicine. Isa was an artist who abandoned art. Marcus and Isa are married, and Isa left her art career. Perhaps he was involved in the conflict with Caro? Maybe Caro had feelings for him, leading to the split.\n   - Motivations: Support Isa, keep his family united.\n   - Relationships: Married to Isa, Harper's stepfather or biological father? If the betrayal was between Caro and Marcus, he would be connected. So if Caro and Marcus had an affair, but that might complicate.\n\n5. Daniel (Caro's husband)\n   - Age: 50\n   - Physical: Maybe a ferry captain or a pilot, since Caro is traveling by ferries and budget flights. Wait, Caro is traveling on ferries and budget flights, not Daniel necessarily. Daniel could have a different profession. Maybe a chef?\n   - Personality: Creative, Patient, Cynical\n   - Backstory: Caro married him 15 years ago, after the split. He's maybe a stabilizing force for her. Not from their Ohio past.\n   - Motivations: Support Caro, maybe wants to reunite the family. Or Daniel is absent, but not sure.\n\n6. Jonah (Supporting, perhaps Caro's stepson or another child. Wait, user says \"grown children\" plural. The baby's mother is Harper, so \"grown children\" must include Harper and another. Let's create Jonah as Caro's adopted son or stepson, or maybe Isa has another child. But if the story needs another grown child perspective, perhaps Harper's cousin, son of Caro. Wait, Caro doesn't have a child in the original description. So to complete the story, user says we can create new characters. So Caro may have a son, Jonah, who's a grown child, making him part of the perspectives. Then Jonah could be involved somehow. Or perhaps Harper's partner.\n\nBut maybe the two grown children are Harper and Jonah, Harper being Isa's daughter and Jonah Caro's son, both of similar age. That would make sense. So:\n\n6. Jonah (Caro's son)\n   - Age: 25\n   - Physical: Maybe resembles Caro, more into tech or something. Or maybe an artist.\n   - Personality: Observant, Sardonic, Protective, Naïve.\n   - Backstory: Doesn't know much about the rift, but affected by it. Maybe estranged from Isa's side.\n   - Motivations: Understand his family's history, support his mother.\n   - Relationships: Son of Caro, cousin to Harper, maybe.\n\n7. Dr. Min-Jae Kim (Supporting)\n   - Age: 45\n   - Physical: Stern, professional.\n   - Role: NICU doctor treating the baby.\n   - Could represent the medicine aspect, and his interactions with both sisters would be key.\n\n8. Nurse Hana\n   - Age: 30\n   - Personality: Compassionate, Insightful\n   - Helps the sisters in the hospital, maybe has her own subplot.\n\nWait, but the example in the book description mentions \"grown children\"—so maybe those are Harper and Jonah. The husbands are Marcus and Daniel. Then parents are Isa, Caro, and two children. Plus two more characters: Dr. Kim and Nurse Hana? But that's 7. Wait, need 8. Alternatively, the \"grown children\" could be Harper and the baby's father, who is her partner. But the baby's father would be an adult, so maybe Ethan, Harper's boyfriend. Then eight characters: Isa, Caro, Marcus, Daniel, Harper, Ethan, Jonah, Dr. Kim. Wait, but user said \"grown children\" plural, which might include Jonah and Harper. So maybe the two children are Harper and Jonah, with Jonah being Caro's son. That gets us to 6: Isa, Caro, Marcus, Daniel, Harper, Jonah. Then add two more: Dr. Kim and Nurse Hana. That's eight.\n\nBut the user's example might expect the eight to be the two sisters, two husbands, two grown children (Harper and another), and two more. Alternatively, maybe the husbands and grown children are four, making total with sisters eight. Wait, no: 2 sisters + 2 husbands + 2 grown children = 6. Then add two more? The problem states \"each woman carries the weight of betrayal and what they left behind\"—maybe the men they left behind, so previous partners. But perhaps the user's instruction requires exactly 8 main characters including all the perspective characters. Let me think again.\n\nThe book is told in shifting perspectives: Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children. So four perspectives: Isa, Caro, their husbands (plural—so two), and the grown children (plural—so two). That totals 2+2+2=6? Wait, \"their husbands\" meaning each sister's husband, so two husbands. \"The grown children\" meaning Isa and Caro's children. If Isa has one child (Harper) and Caro has one (maybe Jonah), then that's two grown children, making 2 sisters, 2 husbands, 2 grown children. Then six main characters. But user says the book requires eight main characters. Hmm. So maybe there are two more, perhaps other children or additional perspective characters. Alternatively, the grown children could be two per sister? But that would be a lot.\n\nWait, the user says \"create the following number of main characters: 8\". So the JSON array should have 8 entries. Let me see: the book's description says \"braids past and present, Ohio and East Asia, painting and medicine, until the latitude...\". So maybe the eight include the two sisters, their two husbands, two grown children (Harper and Jonah), and two medical professionals (Dr. Kim and Nurse Hana). That makes eight.\n\nLet's proceed with that structure. Now, each character's profile.\n\nIsa: Protagonist, estranged sister, artist. Her journey on Trans-Siberian.\n\nCaro: Other protagonist, sister, doctor.\n\nMarcus: Isa's husband, medical researcher, maybe helped her leave art. Caro might have had a conflict with him.\n\nDaniel: Caro's husband, maybe a chef or something non-medical, more artistic, contrasting with Marcus.\n\nHarper: Isa's daughter, 28, mother of the baby. Her husband's perspective could be Ethan, the baby's father. Wait, but user said \"grown children\" as plural. Alternatively, Ethan could be another main character. Let me adjust:\n\n1. Isa\n2. Caro\n3. Marcus (Isa's husband)\n4. Daniel (Caro's husband)\n5. Harper (Isa's daughter)\n6. Ethan (Harper's partner, baby's father)\n7. Dr. Min-Jae Kim\n8. Jonah (Isa's son or Caro's son?)\n\nHmm, but user might prefer the \"grown children\" to be Harper and Jonah, if Jonah is another child. If Isa has two children, Harper and Jonah, then Caro's niece and nephew. Or Caro has Jonah as her son. Let me try making Caro have a son, Jonah, 25, who knows Harper. So that the grown children are Jonah and Harper. Then:\n\nGrown Children: Harper (Isa's daughter) and Jonah (Caro's son). Then that's two more main characters.\n\nSo total of eight:\n\nSisters: Isa, Caro\n\nHusbands: Marcus, Daniel\n\nGrown children: Harper, Jonah\n\nMedical staff: Dr. Kim and Nurse Hana.\n\nWait, that's eight. Alternatively, maybe two more people not related. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sisters' husbands and two of their children. But Harper is Isa's daughter. If Caro has a son, Jonah, then those two grown children. Then eight total when adding both.\n\nNow, relationships. The initial conflict between Isa and Caro might be that Caro had an affair with Marcus, leading to their estrangement. So 15 years ago, Caro and Marcus had an affair, which is the betrayal. Then Isa left Marcus, or Caro left them. Then Marcus's backstory includes that. But now they're all estranged.\n\nIsa's husband Marcus: He might have been involved in the betrayal with Caro. Caro's husband Daniel could be someone she met after moving to East Asia. Let me structure their backstories accordingly.\n\nFor each character, I need to create their background, motivations, conflicts, etc., and relationships.\n\nIsa's internal conflict could be guilt over abandoning her art and resentment towards Caro. External: the journey's challenges.\n\nCaro's internal conflict: guilt over betraying Isa, perhaps by having an affair with Marcus. External: her travel challenges and fear of rejection.\n\nHarper's motivation: her baby's survival and dealing with her own family's issues.\n\nJonah's perspective might be dealing with his mother's past and the family rift.\n\nDr. Kim and Nurse Hana can have their own subplots, but as main characters, perhaps their interactions with Isa and Caro push the story. Alternatively, maybe the husbands and children have their own motivations tied to the journey.\n\nWait, but the husbands may not be on the journey. The book description says \"their parallel journeys—Isa on the Trans-Siberian and Caro on ferries and budget flights—force them to confront the men they left behind\"—so the men they left behind would be the husbands? Or previous lovers. So Marcus could be a man Isa left behind in Ohio, but now is her husband? Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, the sisters are confronting the men they left behind 15 years ago. So during their estrangement period. So Isa left behind Marcus, or a previous partner? Or Caro left behind a man from 15 years ago. The user says \"the men they left behind, the art they abandoned, and the moment their shared story cracked\". So the men they left behind might be connected to the rift. Maybe Isa left behind her lover (who is now Marcus?) or Caro left behind hers. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe husbands may be current, but the men they left behind could be from 15 years ago. So perhaps Isa's ex or lover she left behind, but now married to Marcus. Or Marcus IS the man she left behind? No, because they are now estranged. Wait, the sisters estranged. The men they left behind might be during the time they split.\n\nLet me create a backstory. Maybe 15 years ago, Isa was an artist in Ohio, her fiancé was a man named Ethan. Caro was studying medicine, and had an affair with Ethan, leading Isa to abandon art and her relationship, and Caro abandoned medicine. But this is conflicting. Alternatively, Isa and Caro were both in Ohio, maybe Caro was a medical student and Isa an artist. They both loved someone, maybe a man named Daniel, who ended up with Caro, leading Isa to resent her. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the betrayal was over a romantic entanglement. Perhaps when they were younger, Caro slept with Isa's boyfriend/fiancé Marcus, leading Isa to cut ties, abandon her art career, move to Siberia, while Caro became a doctor and married Daniel. But that's just one possibility. Need to make their backstory compelling.\n\nAlternatively, the key event was that Caro stole Isa's scholarship or opportunity, but the book mentions \"the men they left behind\". So likely romantic.\n\nLet me structure the betrayal as follows: When they were young women in Ohio, Isa was an aspiring painter, Caro a medical student. Isa was engaged to Marcus, but during a crisis (maybe Isa's infertility), Caro and Marcus had a one-time affair. Isa found out, cut ties with both. Caro moved to East Asia to pursue medicine, Isa left Marcus and moved to Russia or Siberia (to work on art maybe), but eventually married again. Wait, but the husbands are Marcus and their other husbands. Wait, but Isa would have Marcus as her husband if the affair was with him. Hmm, perhaps Isa married Marcus before they split. So they were married, and Caro had an affair with him. That would explain the betrayal. Then Isa left both Marcus and Caro, but now she's married to Marcus? That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe now they are divorced, and Isa's current husband is someone else. But the problem states \"their husbands\" implying that both are married now. So perhaps Isa's current husband is someone else, and Marcus was the ex. But the book description says \"their husbands\" are part of the perspectives. Maybe they are still married. So perhaps after the affair, Marcus stayed with Isa, but there was a rift between the sisters. That could complicate things.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me outline the relationships:\n\n- Isa and Caro were close sisters in Ohio. Something happened 15 years ago that split them. The betrayal could be romantic. The men they left behind could be Marcus and Daniel. Or maybe:\n\n- Caro abandoned her fiancé or lover, who is now a figure from her past. But the husbands now are perhaps new ones. Alternatively, the current husbands are the same from 15 years ago, but if there was betrayal involving them, maybe not. Let's try:\n\nIsa's husband Marcus (current), but 15 years ago, Caro had an affair with him, leading to their estrangement. So Marcus is still married to Isa, but there's lingering resentment. Caro's husband is Daniel, whom she married after moving to East Asia.\n\nBut then the \"men they left behind\" might refer to Marcus and Daniel? Or other men. Alternatively, Isa left behind her lover Marcus and Caro left behind her lover. Maybe each had a man they left behind in Ohio. But they might have moved on.\n\nAlternatively, the men could be someone else, like their father. But the book mentions \"the men they left behind\" in the context of the rift, so probably related to their own relationships.\n\nThis needs to be clear in the profiles. Let me proceed to draft each character with this in mind.\n\nFor each character, I need to create a detailed profile with the specified elements. Let's start with Isa.\n\nIsa: Name, age, physical description, personality, backstory, motivations, relationships, role, internal and external conflicts, character arc.\n\nSimilarly for the others. I need to ensure that the relationships between characters are established, possibly creating new ones. So:\n\n1. Isa: Protagonist. Sister to Caro. Former artist. Estranged for 15 years. Married to Marcus, but he had an affair with Caro. Now traveling to Seoul.\n\n2. Caro: Protagonist. Former medical student, now a doctor. Estranged from Isa. Married to Daniel. Mother of Jonah?\n\n3. Marcus: Isa's husband. Medical researcher. Had an affair with Caro 15 years ago. Now remorseful.\n\n4. Daniel: Caro's husband, supportive. Maybe a chef. Doesn't know about the past.\n\n5. Harper: Isa's daughter, 28. Premature baby's mother. Doesn't know full story between her mom and aunt.\n\n6. Jonah: Caro's son, 25, maybe a struggling artist. Connects to Isa's past.\n\n7. Dr. Min-Jae Kim: The NICU doctor in Seoul. Maybe has a personal stake in the case.\n\n8. Nurse Hana: A connecting character in the hospital, maybe with a past similar to the sisters.\n\nAlternatively, the eighth character could be someone from their past, like an old friend or family member. But need to stick to the given info.\n\nAlso, the story is set in Ohio and East Asia. So maybe Caro moved to Korea, Isa in Russia (Trans-Siberian). So their husbands: Marcus might be a professor in Ohio, then moved to live with Isa in Russia? Or Marcus is in Ohio, and Isa left him? Wait, the sisters estranged 15 years ago. Isa's journey is on Trans-Siberian, so she might be in Russia now. Caro might be in the US, traveling via ferries and budget flights to Seoul, so perhaps she's in Japan or somewhere.\n\nI think I have a rough structure. Now, proceed to create each profile with all the required fields.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":534,"completion_tokens":9526,"total_tokens":10060}}
