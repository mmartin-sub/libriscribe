He recounts his abandonment in 1996 and forces the sisters to confront their complicity in buried atrocities.\n\nThe overhead fluorescents flicker once and die, replaced by a single emergency strip that paints the control room the color of old iodine. Isa smells diesel exhaust trapped in the walls and her own sweat turning cold under borrowed Kevlar. Caro stands closer than breathing, but the space between them feels radioactive.\n\nA boot scrapes metal. From the stairwell’s throat a man unfolds, coat flaring like black wings. The pistol in his right hand is steady; the left holds a leather-bound notebook swollen by damp years. Snow crystals glitter in his hair and melt along the scar that lifts half his upper lip.\n\n“Twenty-seven winters I rehearsed this moment,” he says in Spanish that still carries Budapest vowels. “Choose the language you betrayed me in.”\n\nCaro’s exhale fogs the glass. “Varga.” The name lands like a dropped vial.\n\nIsa’s mind rifles through trauma protocols—distance, angle, exit routes—but her feet stay nailed to the grating. She recognizes the notebook: their mother’s field log, last seen in a Chongjin clinic before the mortars hit.\n\nVarga circles until the barrel finds the exact spot between Caro’s shoulder blades where the scapula wings. “Tell her what you told the tribunal, Doctora. How the North Koreans ‘insisted’ on directing our convoy. How you ‘had no choice’ but to leave the wounded behind.”\n\nThe cold makes Caro’s voice brittle. “We were saving the ones we could.”\n\n“By locking the doors?” He flips the notebook open with his thumb; pages rustle like dry leaves. “Page forty-two. ‘Interpreter refuses evacuation, demands return for civilians.’ Your mother wrote that while you held the pen.”\n\nIsa tastes copper where her teeth meet her tongue. “We didn’t know they’d shell the market.”\n\n“But you knew they could.” Varga taps the pistol against Caro’s spine once, like punctuation. “And when the smoke cleared, you renamed it collateral damage, stamped it confidential, flew home to your boards and your awards. While I spent three years in a mining camp learning how thin a man can get.”\n\nOutside, wind rattles the antennae. Isa feels each vibration in her molars. “You want an apology.”\n\n“I want the arithmetic.” He steps back, gesturing toward the container below with the notebook. “Two children for thirty-seven civilians. Your mother always said medicine was about balance.”\n\nCaro turns then, slowly, palms open. Snow dusts her eyelashes like ash. “They’re your nieces, Varga. Luna has your sister’s eyes.”\n\nThe pistol wavers for the first time. “My sister bled out on Route 17 because your convoy didn’t stop. Don’t speak to me of eyes.”\n\nIsa’s hand drifts toward the laptop. The screen saver shifts: blood-red pixels pooling, erasing, pooling again. She imagines the upload as a hemorrhage that cannot be staunched. “Then why give us the choice?”\n\n“Because absolution purchased cheap is indistinguishable from guilt.” He lays the notebook on the console beside the lever. Ink has bloomed through the pages, turning dates and dosages into bruises. “Your mother died believing she’d protected you from this. I’m correcting the record.”\n\nCaro picks up the log. Her thumb traces a smear that might once have been a signature. “She wrote you letters. Every Christmas. They came back marked ‘deceased.’”\n\n“Dead men don’t read.” Varga’s laugh is winter wind through pine needles. “But they listen. I heard the lullaby you sing to the little one—‘blood is thicker than water’—and I thought, yes, but water drowns just the same.”\n\nA low metallic thud echoes from the container; Luna kicking the wall in Morse code they taught her last summer: H-U-R-T. Caro’s shoulders jerk as if the bullet has already entered.\n\nIsa steps between them. The pistol’s muzzle fills her vision, black and perfect as a pupil. “Shoot me if you want. The file uploads automatically if my heart stops.”\n\n“Isa—” Caro’s protest is half-sob.\n\nBut Varga lowers the weapon. Snow hisses against the barrel. “You still believe sacrifice is noble. Your mother taught you that too.” He nods toward the glass, where Min’s small silhouette presses against the frosted pane. “Make the children watch, or make them free. Either way, you carry it.”\n\nThe emergency strip sputters, then steadies. In its sickly glow the three of them stand like actors caught between scenes, waiting for the next line they already know by heart.\n\nCaro closes the notebook and sets it beside the lever. The leather is warm from her grip. “We’ll choose,” she says. “But we choose together.”\n\nVarga holsters the pistol. “Then hurry. Dawn breaks hard on this latitude.”\n\nHe turns his back on them—an act of trust or contempt—and starts down the stairs. The notebook stays behind, a mute witness. Through the glass, Luna’s silhouette lifts a hand: not waving, but reaching.\n\nIsa’s fingers find Caro’s. Their knuckles whiten around the cold metal lever. Somewhere below, a single detonator clicks, arming itself for whatever comes next.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":669,"completion_tokens":1176,"total_tokens":1845,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
