She recalls Harper’s secret move to Seoul for an art internship but never told Isa, flooding her with guilt over the fractured family ties.\n\nThe dial tone is still droning when Caro slams the receiver back onto the cradle. 4:17 a.m.—three red digits glaring from the microwave, the only light in the kitchen besides the green exit sign bleeding through the half-open window. The apartment smells of burnt coffee from two hours ago and the ghost-odor of gesso that never quite leaves the floorboards. She spins, barefoot, and the sticky linoleum tugs at her soles like a warning.\n\n“Okay, okay,” she whispers, as if repetition can unsnarl the knots in her stomach. The Samsung doctor had sounded calm, almost bored, but the words keep ricocheting—premature, hemorrhage, consent. Harper’s name had landed like a dropped plate.\n\nShe lunges for the living room. The overhead bulb flickers once before it remembers its job. The coffee table is an archaeological dig—loose charcoal sticks, a chipped mug holding brushes instead of pens, and beneath everything the cracked leather address book she hasn’t opened since the last time she swore she’d draw every day. Its spine protests with a papery sigh when she yanks it open. Pages flutter: gallery receipts, a dried maple leaf, the corner of a Polaroid where two teenage sisters press frosting-smeared cheeks together. Ohio, fifteen years ago, the night before everything split.\n\nIsa’s last entry is in violet ink, the color she used to grade Caro’s high-school essays. A Berlin landline, crossed out. A cell number with the old +49 country code. Another line, newer but still two years old: Trans-Siberian Rail—Emergency sat-phone? Underlined three times, never tested. Caro thumbs the paper; the ink smudges under the sweat of her thumbprint.\n\n“Pick up, pick up,” she chants, punching numbers into the cordless. A mechanical voice answers in German, then English: This number is no longer in service. She jabs END so hard the plastic creaks.\n\nThe apartment feels suddenly cavernous, cluttered canyons of half-finished canvases leaning like tired soldiers. She knocks one over—an abandoned portrait of Harper at six, strawberry juice on her chin—and the canvas claps against the floorboards, raising dust that tastes of chalk and regret.\n\n“Think.” She drags both hands through her hair, paint still crusted under her nails from yesterday’s failed sky study. Where do people keep current information? Not in books, apparently. Her abandoned laptop lies on the futon like a closed clam. She flips it open; the fan wheezes awake. The screen throbs to life, asking for a password she can’t remember. She tries Harper’s birthday—no. Isa’s birthday—no. The cat they had in college—also no. Three tries, then the machine locks her out with a smug little chime.\n\n“Shit.” The word punches out louder than she expected; somewhere down the hall a neighbor’s dog barks once in lazy protest.\n\nCaro paces. The floorboards complain under her weight, broadcasting her panic to the entire building. Past the futon, past the window where Seoul’s neon is still drunk and pink at four-thirty in the morning. She presses her forehead to the cool glass. Down on the sidewalk, a delivery scooter idles, headlights pooling over wet asphalt. Normal city. Normal night. Nothing about this is normal.\n\nHer gaze snags on the sketchbook lying open on the windowsill. The one she grabbed on instinct after the call, as if charcoal could fix geography. The page shows nothing but a single looping line—an unsteady horizon from the moment her hand shook. She remembers Harper balanced on this very sill last winter, boots dripping snow on the radiator, whispering, “Don’t tell Mom yet, okay? I got the internship. Six months. I just need…space.”\n\nAnd Caro had nodded, coward’s bargain. Easier to keep the secret than to open the fault line that had cracked their family open years ago. Now that bargain feels like swallowing glass.\n\nShe spins back to the address book. Somewhere in the jumble of pages, a train schedule flutters out—Trans-Siberian, Moscow to Beijing, 9,289 kilometers, six nights. Isa’s looping handwriting in the margins: No planes. Ever. Beneath it, a faint penciled note in Caro’s own hand: If something happens, try carriage attendants—Satellite relay on board?\n\nHer pulse quickens. She needs the rail company’s emergency contact. But the apartment mocks her: drawers vomiting tangled chargers, a stack of unopened mail avalanching when she tugs the wrong envelope. She finds a 2019 phone bill, a coupon for a noodle place that closed during the pandemic, a postcard from Harper sent from Paris last spring—Wish you were here, the city eats colors—but no rail number.\n\nShe stops in the middle of the rug, breathing hard. The room tilts around her like a carnival ride. She sees herself from above: barefoot woman in paint-stained T-shirt, clutching an obsolete address book, ringed by the debris of a life spent making art about distance but never crossing any.\n\nThe guilt is sudden and tidal, rising so fast she has to brace a hand on the wall. She should have told Isa. Should have forwarded every email, every photo of Harper sketching in Gwanghwamun Square, every late-night text that said, “Aunt Caro, I’m scared I’m not good enough.” Instead she let the silence stretch, the same silence that started the night Isa boarded that midnight train to Strasbourg fifteen years ago while Caro stood on the platform, sketchbook clutched to her chest, promising she’d follow. She never did.\n\nA siren dopplers down the boulevard, reminding her that time is still moving. Harper is in an operating theater right now. Isa is somewhere east of Warsaw, probably asleep in a couchette with the window open to the smell of birch forests, unreachable by anything short of a miracle.\n\nCaro’s knees buckle. She sinks to the floor amid the spilled sketches, hands trembling. Her phone buzzes—an unknown Korean number. She swipes accept with a thumb that leaves a streak of cobalt on the screen.\n\n“Ms. Valente?” The same calm doctor. “We’re proceeding, but we need authorization for neonatal blood transfusion. How soon can you be here?”\n\n“I—” Her voice cracks. She looks around at the chaos, the unreachable past stacked in every corner. “I’m coming. Just—buy me an hour.”\n\nA beat. “We’ll do our best.” Click.\n\nSilence blooms again, louder than the siren. She closes her eyes, feels the apartment pressing in, all the unfinished canvases staring like witnesses. Then, deliberate, she reaches for the sketchbook. Rips out the looping horizon. On the blank back, she writes Isa’s full name, the train’s route, the date—anything that might anchor her when the world tilts again. She folds the paper small enough to fit in her pocket, next to her passport and the last cash from the jar above the fridge.\n\nOne hour. She can make the first subway if she runs.\n\nCaro stands. In the cracked mirror by the door her reflection is wild-eyed, streaked with charcoal where she dragged anxious fingers across her cheek. She looks, for a moment, exactly like the teenager who once promised her sister the world and delivered only distance.\n\nShe grabs the prepaid phone she bought for tourists who never came, shoves it into the same pocket as the folded sketch. At the threshold she pauses, hand on the knob, and allows herself one last glance at the apartment—at the overturned portrait, the silent laptop, the address book splayed like a broken bird.\n\n“I’m coming,” she repeats, to the room, to the ghosts, to the sister who can’t hear her. Then she steps into the hall, pulls the door shut, and the lock clicks like the punctuation at the end of a sentence she never meant to write.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":635,"completion_tokens":1766,"total_tokens":2401,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
