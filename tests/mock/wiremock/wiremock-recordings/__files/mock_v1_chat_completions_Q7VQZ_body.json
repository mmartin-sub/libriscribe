Flashbacks of scattering their mother’s ashes here surface, complicating their search until they find the capsule containing a flash drive and a Korean hanja lullaby fragment.\n\nThe wind comes off the Rhine like a slap, slicing through Isa’s coat and carrying the smell of diesel and wet stone. She grips the railing, knuckles whitening. Below, the river slides black and wide beneath the iron lattice of the bridge, its surface freckled by rain.\n\nCaro stands ten feet away at the opposite parapet, one boot hooked on the lowest rung of the maintenance ladder that snakes down into the girders. She doesn’t look back when she speaks. “49.4875 North, 8.4669 East. This is it. Exact middle of the span.”\n\nIsa’s mouth tastes of metal. She hasn’t stood here since the day they opened their mother’s urn and the ashes scattered like pale wings—fine enough to ride the updraft, coarse enough that some grains stuck to her wet lashes. That was fifteen years ago, the same autumn chill, the same river hush. Same guilt.\n\nCaro descends two rungs. Ice crackles under her gloves. “You coming or just cataloging regrets?”\n\nIsa swallows. “I’m coming.”\n\nThe lattice is a skeleton of rust-red beams and cross-braces, slick with November rain. They climb sideways, backs to the water, boots wedging for purchase. Isa’s breath fogs the rivets. Each step knocks loose a memory: the soft weight of the urn in her arms, Caro’s voice cracking on the Korean prayer she never bothered to learn, the plink of bone fragments against the railing.\n\nHalfway down, Caro stops. “There.”\n\nA finger-thick capsule, matte orange, clipped to a cable with a stainless-steel carabiner. It sways in the wind, tapping the iron like a heartbeat. Caro reaches first, fingers brushing it, then hesitates. “You do it.”\n\nIsa blinks rain from her lashes. “Why?”\n\n“Because you owe her more than I do.”\n\nThe words sting sharper than the wind. Isa unhooks the capsule. It’s heavier than expected, the plastic scored by cold. She thumbs the rubber gasket, feels the O-ring give. Inside: a thumb drive sealed in a tiny zip-bag and a folded square of rice paper.\n\nCaro climbs back up to the walkway. Isa follows, boots slipping once, the river yawning below. On the pavement they huddle under the weak orange glow of a sodium lamp. Rain drums the awning of a locked souvenir kiosk.\n\nCaro tears open the zip-bag with her teeth. The drive is unmarked, gunmetal gray. Isa unfolds the rice paper. Hanja characters bloom like bruises across the grain:\n\n잠이 들면 / 바람결에 / 그림자 피고  \nWhen you sleep / in the path of the wind / shadows take root\n\nHer throat locks. She hears the lullaby in their mother’s voice, the low hum she used when Seoul’s sirens went off and the blackout curtains couldn’t muffle the world. Isa had pretended not to know the words; easier to fake sleep than admit she understood every syllable and still enlisted under a forged medical waiver.\n\nCaro’s voice is almost drowned by the rain. “She wrote that the week before she left for Bosnia.” A pause. “You never asked what it meant.”\n\n“I was nineteen,” Isa mutters. “I thought meaning was negotiable.”\n\nCaro wipes water from her brow with the heel of her hand. “Let’s see what else she left us.”\n\nShe pulls a rugged tablet from her coat, slots the drive. A folder opens: RC_96-11-17_Medak_Pocket_Redacted.pdf. The thumbnail shows a Red Cross crest, a stamp reading SECRET—EYES ONLY. Caro taps it. Lines of blacked-out Cyrillic and English scroll past. A photograph unblurs: a woman in blue coveralls, face obscured by a surgical mask, but the eyes—dark, certain—belong unmistakably to their mother.\n\nIsa’s pulse skids. “She was there. November ’96. Medak Pocket.”\n\nCaro’s reply is a whisper. “And she never told us.”\n\nBelow them a barge horn moans, low and mournful. Headlights sweep the bridge as a lone car crosses, tires hissing on wet asphalt. Isa folds the rice paper back into its square, creasing the edges like a prayer.\n\nCaro pockets the drive. “Next coordinate?”\n\nIsa checks the phone: 48.3026 N 14.2861 E. Danube, Linz. She angles the screen so Caro can see the blue pin hovering over Austria.\n\nCaro exhales a cloud of frost. “More ghosts, then.”\n\nIsa almost smiles. “We’re good at ghosts.”\n\nThey start back toward the rental car, footfalls syncing without meaning to. Behind them the bridge hums, the capsule’s empty carabiner still swinging like a pendulum marking time neither of them can get back.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":680,"completion_tokens":1115,"total_tokens":1795,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
