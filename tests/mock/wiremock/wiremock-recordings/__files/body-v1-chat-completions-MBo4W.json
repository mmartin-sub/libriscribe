She blinks awake to darkness the color of wet slate, the window a black mirror reflecting her own startled eyes. For three heartbeats she has no idea where she is—then the smell of diesel and boiled wool settles over her like a tarpaulin: Berlin-Moscow express, berth 4, car 12. The rhythm beneath her is no longer Ohio gravel but Russian rail joints, a cold and unforgiving heartbeat.\n\nHer phone buzzes on the little fold-down shelf, skittering toward the edge like it’s trying to escape. The screen lights the compartment: one missed call, 02:17 from +82-10-****-****. Seoul.\n\nShe fumbles for it, fingers too thick, too slow. The glow hurts her eyes. One voicemail—thirty-seven seconds.\n\nShe presses play, clamps the speaker to her ear. Static first, the hiss of distance and metal. Then Harper’s voice, shredded by signal loss, rising and falling like weather.\n\n“—sa? It’s—cutting—the bleeding won’t—Seoul, they said—told you not to—”\n\nA clatter that might be a dropped receiver, a shout in Korean too fast for her to catch. Then Caro’s voice, farther off, cracked in half: “Tell her we’re at—National University—trauma—”\n\nThe message ends in mid-word, a door slammed on a scream.\n\nIsa’s pulse fills the silence. She replays it, thumbs shaking so hard she almost drops the phone again. Harper. Bleeding. Trauma. National University Hospital. Seoul. The fragments collide, refuse to fit.\n\nShe swings her legs over the bunk. The sheets tangle, smell of sleep and train sweat. Her bare feet find the cold steel floor. Somewhere beyond the door a baby coughs, rhythmic as a metronome. The corridor light leaks in under the blind, a narrow blade that slices across her duffel, her boots, the envelope she taped beneath the mattress like contraband—fifteen years of letters she never sent to Caro. The weight of it seems suddenly ridiculous; paper can’t plug a wound.\n\nShe cracks the door. A conductor in a navy jacket is retreating toward the dining car, the red tip of a cigarette flaring. The air out here smells of instant coffee and coal smoke.\n\n“Entschuldigung,” she calls, voice cracking. “Wi-Fi?”\n\nHe turns, eyebrows lifted. No English, or pretending not to. She pulls a folded twenty-euro note from the pocket of her hoodie, the paper warm from her skin. His eyes flick from the bill to her face, calculating.\n\n“Dining car,” he says in English after all. “One hour.”\n\nOne hour. Harper could bleed out in one hour. She pictures Caro in a waiting room vinyl chair, knuckles white around her phone, the same chair where she once waited while their son Jonah got three stitches after falling from the apple tree. Same chair, different decade, whole ocean in between.\n\nBack in the berth she drags on jeans, boots, Caro’s old fisherman sweater that still smells faintly of woodsmoke from the farmhouse stove. She replays the voicemail once more, tilting the phone as if the angle might let the meaning slide through. The train sways; the signal bar flickers from one to none and back. She writes the words she caught on the back of her boarding pass: Harper, bleeding, Seoul, National University. The pen skids, rips the card. Ink blooms like a bruise.\n\nThe envelope under the mattress crinkles when she shifts her weight. Two hundred and thirty-seven letters, every one beginning with I should have told you sooner. She hasn’t opened it since Kraków. The flap is sealed with duct tape and guilt.\n\nAt 03:05 the dining car lights blaze like a hospital corridor. She slips into the first booth, orders black tea she won’t drink, and watches the snow begin beyond the window—flakes swept into the headlight, tiny white fists that melt on the glass. A dozen seats away, a woman knits something red and unravels half of every row, as if the motion itself matters more than the finished shape.\n\nIsa opens her notebook—same battered Moleskine she’s carried since the fellowship rejection—and writes:\n\nCaro,\n\nI should have told you sooner that the apples didn’t taste the same after you left. That Jonah stopped climbing trees. That I kept the Strasbourg letter in my sketchbook because seeing it every day felt like keeping a candle lit for both of us.\n\nShe stops. The train lurches again, and the ink bleeds sideways, a tiny arterial spray across the margin.\n\nHer phone buzzes: new email. Sender: Unknown. Subject line empty. She opens it. Coordinates, nothing else. She plugs them into the map app—nothing loads. She’s somewhere east of Smolensk, west of the Urals, floating in a pocket of dead air.\n\nShe closes the notebook, tucks it inside the envelope’s open edge. The letters shift like restless birds.\n\nOutside, the snow thickens. The window turns opaque, erasing the world. Isa presses her forehead to the cold pane and feels the train barrel forward, relentless, carrying her away from everything she failed to save and toward the only thing left to try.\n\nThe conductor appears at the far end, pocketing money from a backpacker. When he catches her eye, he gives the smallest nod. Connection in thirty minutes, she translates. Just enough time to fly from Vladivostok if she gets off at the next stop and never looks back.\n\nShe smooths the torn boarding pass against the table, folds it into a tiny square, and slips it into the envelope with the letters. Paper against paper; the weight of words, the lightness of flight.\n\nThe train whistle cuts through the night, a long, grieving note. Isa stands, shoulders her duffel, and heads for the vestibule before the next doubt can find her.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":546,"completion_tokens":1316,"total_tokens":1862,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
