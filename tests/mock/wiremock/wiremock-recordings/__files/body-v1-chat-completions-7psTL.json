Her breath comes in ragged, crystalline bursts; every exhale is a small white flag. Beside her, Caro’s dark hair is rimmed with frost, the strands stiff as wire. They had been shouting—about blame, about blood, about who first taught whom to run instead of fight—until the metal between them rang like a bell.\n\nThen, through that same metal, a voice:\n\n“We’re not bargaining chips.”\n\nLuna’s words shake, but they carry. The wind drops, shocked. Inside the container, Min’s muffled sob answers like an echo.\n\nIsa’s knees buckle before her mind catches up. The snow crunches beneath her weight, sharp crystals biting through the fabric of her trousers. Caro sinks beside her, palms already spread against the wall as if it were skin she could warm. Rust flakes away beneath their touch, revealing colder steel beneath.\n\n“Luna,” Isa whispers. The name fogs against the metal, a ghost that won’t stay put.\n\n“Mom.” The reply is smaller now, threaded with static. “I can’t feel my toes, but I can hear you breathing. Both of you. You’re arguing like the river isn’t right there, waiting.”\n\nCaro’s breath catches, turns into a cough that tastes of iron. She leans her forehead to the wall. On the other side, inches away, her daughter sits wired to enough explosive to erase last names.\n\n“I used to sing that lullaby to you,” Caro says, voice raspy. “The one about blood and water. I thought if I hummed loud enough, the river would forget its own name.”\n\nA pause. Snow ticks against the corrugated roof like failing Morse code.\n\n“It’s not the river’s job to forget,” Luna answers. “It’s yours.”\n\nCaro’s shoulders fold inward. Isa reaches—slow, tentative—until her gloved fingers brush Caro’s sleeve. The fabric is stiff with ice, but beneath it she feels the tremor of a heart that has sprinted for twenty-seven years without resting.\n\n“Caro,” Isa says, quietly enough that only the three of them will ever hear. “We kneel now, or we crawl forever.”\n\nSnow begins to fall in heavier flakes, each one a small, cold absolution. They kneel, foreheads to the wall, listening to their children breathe on the other side. Between them, the container’s shadow blackens the snow like a spill of ink, and inside that shadow lies the bomb that measures choice in grams of pressure.\n\nFrom somewhere behind them, the interpreter’s footsteps retreat—one pair of boots crunching away across the riverbank, satisfied or merely finished, impossible to tell. The listening post groans in the wind, antennae quivering like tuning forks that will never find the right note.\n\nCaro lifts her head first. Her eyes are the color of river ice at dusk, reflecting both sky and depth. “When we open that door,” she says, “we open everything. No more quiet reports in locked drawers. No more pretending the water didn’t see.”\n\nIsa nods. She can taste blood where she has bitten through the inside of her cheek; the flavor is metallic, familiar, the taste of every secret she has ever swallowed. She presses her palm flat against the wall, imagining the small curve of Luna’s shoulder on the other side.\n\n“Luna,” she calls, steady now. “We’re coming in. Tell Min to close her eyes when the doors swing.”\n\nA soft laugh, half sob. “Already closed. But I’ll keep talking. Someone has to remind the dark that it’s just the absence of light.”\n\nCaro rises first, then Isa. Their boots squeak against the packed snow as they turn. Ahead, the container’s keypad blinks red beneath a layer of frost. Beyond it, the frozen ribbon of the Tumen waits, carrying moonlight on its back like scattered bones.\n\nThey walk the last three paces shoulder to shoulder, not touching, but close enough that the heat between them melts the snow that clings to their sleeves. The bomb’s timer ticks once more—a sound too soft for ears, but felt in the marrow—then stills, as though holding its breath with them.\n\nAt the threshold, Caro’s hand hovers over the lever. Isa covers it with her own. No words now; the wind has taken them all. Together they push down.\n\nThe latch clicks. Metal groans. A rush of warm, stale air escapes, carrying the faint scent of iodine and fear. Inside, two small figures blink against the sudden daylight, faces streaked with tears that freeze faster than they fall.\n\nBehind them, the first tongue of flame licks up the listening post’s eastern wall, turning the rust into a bright, brief flower. Smoke coils skyward, erasing every last syllable of the lullaby.\n\nCaro steps across the threshold. Isa follows. They do not look back at the fire; they look only at their daughters, at two pairs of eyes reflecting the same river that has carried every secret they ever tried to bury.\n\nSnow keeps falling, soft as apology. The sisters lift the children into their arms. When they step outside again, the world is already different—no longer a ledger of sins and silences, but something wetter, more fluid, something that moves toward the sea whether they wish it or not.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":648,"completion_tokens":1182,"total_tokens":1830,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
