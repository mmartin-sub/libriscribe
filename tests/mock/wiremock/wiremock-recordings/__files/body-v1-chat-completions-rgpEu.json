Caro lifts one from the crate with surgical care, the roots still dewy, breathing like gills. She positions it on the mirrored console beside the living-room window, where the Han River glints thirty-three floors below and the morning sun refracts through triple-pane glass. Every angle is measured: one inch left to catch the light, a quarter-turn so the lowest blossom faces the sofa. Her reflection—black silk blouse, pearl studs, the flawless side-part she’s worn since university—multiplies into infinity inside the mirror.\n\nAcross the room, Min stomps out choreography on a pale-wood floor that never saw a scuff until he learned to moonwalk. The tablet’s speakers thump a bass line Caro refuses to recognize; the boy’s T-shirt swings like a flag. He is all elbows and velocity, nine years of unchecked momentum.\n\n“Min-ah.” Caro slides the orchid forward, aligning its spine with the brass seam in the mirror’s frame. “Line two closes at rush hour. You’ll ride with Mrs. Choi today.”\n\nMin spins, sneakers squeaking. “Eomma, I’m not a baby.” He drags the last vowel into a groan, then drops into a squat, arms crossing over his chest in perfect sync with the dancer onscreen. The motion kicks up a faint smell of grapefruit from the diffuser hidden beneath the sofa.\n\nCaro clips a dried aerial root with her shears. Snip. “The subway is a crush of strangers and a playground for perverts.” She keeps her tone level, conversational, the same register she used last week with the board of directors. “Mrs. Choi drives a Mercedes.”\n\nMin’s bangs flop over his eyes as he pops up, hair still holding yesterday’s salon glaze. “All the kids take the train. Jisung goes alone. Jisung is eight.”\n\n“Jisung’s mother does not have my enemies.”\n\nThe boy pauses the video. Silence blooms, heavy as the humidity trapped inside the orchid crates. Min looks at her—really looks—for the first time all morning. His irises are almost black, like river stones slicked by rain. “Do you have enemies, Eomma?”\n\nCaro places the shears beside the orchid, aligning their handles parallel to the console’s edge. “Everyone with something worth taking has enemies.” She folds the damp newspaper into a perfect square. “Finish your stretches. We leave in fifteen.”\n\nMin scowls but obeys, rolling his shoulders, counting under his breath in English—one and two and three—accent flawless from Saturday tutors. Caro watches the narrow blades of his shoulder blades beneath the cotton. So small, she thinks, yet already practicing how to vanish into crowds. The thought bruises her somewhere private.\n\nThe penthouse smells of orchid sap and imported citrus. Floor-to-ceiling glass turns Seoul into a silent diorama: toy cars on the Teheran-ro, ant-size salarymen scurrying toward glass towers that reflect the sky like polished knives. Here, thirty-three floors up, Caro has engineered a pocket of stillness—white orchids, white sofa, white noise. She checks her watch: 7:12 a.m. Nine hours and twenty-five minutes until everything fractures.\n\nMin grabs his backpack—limited-edition, black with reflective chevrons—and jams the tablet inside. The zipper snags on the headphone cord; he yanks once, twice. “Eomma, can we stop at the bakery? I want the croissant with the chocolate inside.”\n\n“We have croissants in the freezer.”\n\n“They’re not the same.”\n\nCaro lifts the tray of orchids. Porcelain clinks against porcelain as she carries them toward the kitchen island, each pot balanced on a linen napkin to prevent water rings. She hears herself sigh, a sound like silk tearing. “One chocolate croissant. Then straight to the subway entrance. Mrs. Choi will be waiting.”\n\nMin beams, victory in eight-year-old terms. He skips ahead to the elevator, sneakers flashing like semaphore. Caro follows, heels silent on marble. In the reflective brass doors she sees them side by side: her posture a metronome, his limbs already jittering to the beat inside his head. The distance between their shoulders is exactly three orchid pots wide.\n\nThe elevator descends. Thirty-three. Thirty-two. Thirty-one.\n\nMin hums the chorus of whatever song has colonized his brain. Caro closes her eyes. For a moment she smells pine needles and river mud, hears a lullaby in two languages braided together like rope. She opens her eyes. The doors ding open onto marble and morning light.\n\nOutside, the city waits—dense, humming, anonymous. Caro tightens her grip on the tray. Porcelain trembles but does not crack.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":571,"completion_tokens":1079,"total_tokens":1650,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
