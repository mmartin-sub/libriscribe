Simplify magic: Keep the map’s impossible routes; drop the “passable only by the brave” flourish—let the bravery be emotional, not supernatural.  \n2. Anchor guilt in sensory specifics: Isa’s sterile night-lit hospital hallway; Caro’s silent Seoul apartment at 3 a.m.—show, don’t catalog.  \n3. Tighten clock: Instead of “meridian moon,” use one astronomical event (e.g., lunar eclipse visible on both continents) to unify the countdown.  \n4. Re-title something visceral—“Half a Map, Half a World,” “Time Zone Love,” or “The Last Crossing”—while retaining meridian imagery if desired.  \n5. Early chapter outline: Parallel prologues—one child asleep on a Strasbourg-bound train, the other on a Seoul platform—then smash-cut to the stroke and the map in chapter one.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":467,"completion_tokens":894,"total_tokens":1361,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
