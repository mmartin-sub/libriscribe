The chapter is called \"The Fluorescent Hour.\" Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.\n\nFirst, the book's description. The story follows two estranged sisters, Isa and Caro, who must travel across two continents using halves of their late mother's map to reach a rendezvous before a lunar eclipse. Their mother's stroke erased 20 years of silence, forcing them to confront their resentments. Isa is an ICU nurse in Strasbourg, Caro is a diplomat's wife in Seoul. Each has a child, Lila and Min. The chapter summary mentions that both sisters receive a call about their mother's stroke, get the map halves, and start their journey with their kids, ending up on opposite train platforms.\n\nThe user wants exactly 5 scenes, each with Scene Number, Summary, Characters, Setting, Goal, Emotional Beat. All in markdown bullet points. The scenes need to flow naturally and include all main characters from the chapter.\n\nLet me parse the chapter summary into scenes. The first scene is Isa in the ICU resuscitating a teenager when her phone buzzes. That's Scene 1. Then Caro in her kitchen in Seoul, same phone call. That's Scene 2. Then both sisters opening the envelopes, which could be a third scene split into two locations? Or maybe each sister's preparation is separate. Wait, the summary says Isa packs a bag, forges a note, bribes Lila. Caro stuffs passport, promises Min, trades kimchi. Then both on opposite platforms by dawn. So maybe each sister's preparation is a scene each. Then the final scene is their arrival at the train stations. Hmm, but the chapter summary seems to intercut between the two sisters. So perhaps five scenes in total, alternating between Isa and Caro, then maybe a scene where they both start their journeys.\n\nWait, the chapter summary starts with Isa at 3:07 a.m. during a medical emergency, then backtracks to Caro twelve minutes earlier. So the timeline is overlapping. Let me structure the scenes accordingly.\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU resuscitating a patient, then gets the call. Setting: Strasbourg ICU. Characters: Isa, Teenager (maybe unnamed), phone. Emotional beat: Stress, urgency, interrupted.\n\nScene 2: Caro in her kitchen in Seoul, receiving the same call. Setting: Seoul high-rise kitchen. Characters: Caro, Min (maybe not yet, but she's alone here initially). Wait, the summary says Caro is in the kitchen when the call comes. Then she has to deal with Min. Maybe Scene 2 is Caro getting the call, and Scene 3 is her preparing with Min. Similarly, Scene 1 for Isa, then Scene 2 her interacting with Lila. Then Scene 4 and 5 for their travel prep and departure.\n\nWait, the chapter summary mentions both sisters opening the envelopes. Then Isa packs, forges a note, bribes Lila. Caro does similar with Min. Then both on opposite platforms. The user example in the query shows Scene 1 and 2 as Isa and Caro's separate experiences. Let me check the example outline again.\n\nThe example outline in the query shows two different scenes for each sister's initial moment. Then the third scene could be both opening the envelopes? Or maybe each scene alternates between the two. The chapter summary says \"Twelve minutes earlier\" so maybe Scene 1 is Caro's kitchen at 3:07 - 12 = 2:55am? Or maybe the scenes are structured in chronological order with Isa's ICU scene first, then Caro's kitchen, then both of them preparing their kids, then departure. Hmm.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says:\n\nAt 3:07 a.m. in Strasbourg’s ICU, Isa is resuscitating a seizing teenager when phone buzzes. Twelve minutes earlier, Caro was in her kitchen when the same call came. Both open envelopes with the map halves. Then Isa packs, bribes Lila; Caro stuffs passport, deals with Min. By dawn, both on opposite platforms.\n\nSo the timeline is:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU at 3:07am, emergency with patient, gets call about mother's stroke.\n\nScene 2: Caro in Seoul kitchen, same call but twelve minutes earlier. Maybe setting is dark kitchen, foggy Han River.\n\nThen Scene 3: Both sisters open the envelopes. But since they are in different locations, maybe split into two parts? But user wants 5 scenes total. Alternatively, perhaps each sister's opening of the envelope is separate. Wait, the chapter summary says \"both open identical...\" so maybe that's a single scene? No, they are in different places. Maybe Scene 3 is Isa opening the envelope after arriving home, and Scene 4 is Caro opening hers. Then Scene 5 would be both departing. But the user's example has Scene 1 and Scene 2 as separate locations, so perhaps the first two scenes are Isa and Caro's individual moments of the call and initial reaction, then next scenes their interactions with their children, then the departure.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says Isa bribes Lila with Korean fried chicken, and Caro trades kimchi for a conductor's help. So maybe:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, emergency, call comes.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen, call comes.\n\nScene 3: Isa at home, convincing Lila to come with the promise of chicken.\n\nScene 4: Caro at home, convincing Min, using kimchi trade.\n\nScene 5: Both at train platforms, departure.\n\nThat would make five scenes. Each sister's separate actions, then with their kids, then departure. The envelope contents are both opened but in different scenes. Let me check the chapter summary again. The summary says both open the envelopes. So in Scene 1 and 2, they each get the call, then in Scene 3 and 4 they open the envelopes and prepare with their children. Then Scene 5 is the departure.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says \"Both women are on opposite platforms, clutching half a map...\" So Scene 5 would be both at the platforms. But user wants each scene to be separate. So perhaps Scene 5 is two locations again. But the outline needs to have each scene as a separate bullet. The user example shows two scenes in the sample, each with their own bullet points. So each of the five scenes should be individual. So perhaps Scene 1: Isa in ICU. Scene 2: Caro in kitchen. Scene 3: Isa with Lila at home. Scene 4: Caro with Min at home. Scene 5: Both at train platforms. That makes five scenes.\n\nLet me structure each scene accordingly.\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU during emergency, gets the call. Goal is to show her current life and the catalyst.\n\nEmotional beat: Stress, urgency, guilt maybe.\n\nScene 2: Caro in Seoul kitchen, same call. Show her life in Seoul, diplomat's wife, distance from mother. Emotional beat: Shock, dread.\n\nScene 3: Isa opens the envelope, sees the map half, the red circle and note. She decides to go, forges the note, bribes Lila. Interaction with her daughter. Goal to establish the map's importance and reluctant child.\n\nEmotional beat: Nostalgia, confusion, determination.\n\nScene 4: Caro opens the same envelope, same items. She convinces Min, deals with his anxiety. Trade kimchi with conductor. Goal: same as Isa's scene, showing Caro's side.\n\nEmotional beat: Resentment, obligation, maternal pressure.\n\nScene 5: Both sisters at their respective train platforms, preparing to depart. The convergence of their journeys beginning. Goal: Parallel journeys start, emphasize separation but same mission.\n\nEmotional beat: Unease, anticipation, unresolved tension.\n\nWait, but the chapter summary says they end up on opposite platforms. So maybe the fifth scene is both departing, but in separate locations. But each scene in the outline must be a single scene. The user's example in the query shows Scene 1 and Scene 2 as separate, so the outline should have five scenes, each with their own bullet points, not combining both sisters into one scene. So each scene is focused on one sister's perspective, alternating perhaps, but the first two scenes are their separate initial moments, then two scenes with each sister and their child, then fifth scene as both departing. Hmm, but the user's example in the sample they provided in the query (the one with Scene 1 and Scene 2) has each sister in separate scenes. So the outline should have each scene as a separate entity. So five scenes total, each either Isa or Caro, with their own children and settings.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says that Isa and Caro each receive the call at their respective locations, then each interacts with their child. Then by dawn, they are on opposite platforms. So perhaps the five scenes can be:\n\n1. Isa in ICU during emergency, phone rings. She gets the call about her mother. Goal: Introduce Isa's current life and the inciting incident. Emotional beat: Stress, duty vs. family.\n\n2. Caro in Seoul kitchen, same call. Goal: Introduce Caro's life and the inciting incident. Emotional beat: Disconnection, denial.\n\n3. Isa at home opening the envelope, finding the map, red circle, sticky note. She decides to go, forges note, convinces Lila. Goal: Show the map's revelation and strained mother-daughter dynamic. Emotional beat: Nostalgia, resentment.\n\n4. Caro at home with Min, opening the same envelope. Her interaction with Min, promises him it's a family legend. Kimchi trade with conductor. Goal: Parallel to Isa's scene, show Caro's motivations and Min's reluctance. Emotional beat: Pressure, reluctant responsibility.\n\n5. Both sisters at train stations (Isa in Strasbourg, Caro in Seoul/Busan?), departing. Goal: Converging journeys, same deadline. Emotional beat: Anticipation, lingering tension.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says \"both women are on opposite platforms\" so maybe Caro is at a train station in Seoul or another city. The setting for Scene 5 would be two different platforms. But according to the user's instruction, each scene is a single bullet point. So perhaps Scene 5 is two separate scenes merged? But the user wants each scene to be a single setting. So maybe Scene 5 for Isa is her departing from Strasbourg station, and Scene 5 for Caro is her departing from a Seoul station. But the user wants exactly five scenes. So perhaps each of the five scenes alternates between the two sisters. Wait, the chapter summary is structured to intercut both sisters' experiences. So maybe:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, emergency, call comes.\n\nScene 2: Caro in Seoul kitchen, call comes.\n\nScene 3: Isa with Lila, convincing her to join.\n\nScene 4: Caro with Min, convincing him to go.\n\nScene 5: Both sisters at their respective train platforms, beginning their journey.\n\nThat works. Each scene is focused on one sister, and the fifth scene can be two parallel moments. Wait, no. In the user's example, each scene is a separate bullet. So each scene must be a separate moment, either Isa or Caro, not both. So each of the five scenes is either Isa's perspective or Caro's. So the first two scenes are the initial call, then two scenes preparing with their kids, then fifth scene is their departure. That's five scenes. Each scene's setting is separate.\n\nNow, for each scene, I need to list the characters involved. In Scene 1, Isa and maybe the seizing teenager (but maybe not named), and the phone call from the hospital. Scene 2: Caro, the foggy Han River (but only Caro as character, unless Min is already there? Wait, in the chapter summary, when Caro gets the call, she's in the kitchen, then she has to deal with Min. So maybe Scene 2 is just her alone, then Scene 3 she's with Min. Similarly, Scene 3 for Isa is her with Lila.\n\nWait, the summary says \"Isa packs an overnight bag, drafts a forged doctor's note, and bribes her fearless seventeen-year-old daughter, Lila, with the promise of authentic Korean fried chicken. Caro stuffs her passport with diplomatic pouches, promises her anxious ten-year-old son, Min, that missing school will become 'a family legend,' and trades homemade kimchi for a conductor's blind eye.\"\n\nSo the preparation with the children is part of the chapter. So Scenes 3 and 4 would be Isa with Lila, and Caro with Min.\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, attending to patient, then call.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen, call comes.\n\nScene 3: Isa at home, opening the envelope, planning to leave, convincing Lila.\n\nScene 4: Caro at home, opening the envelope, convincing Min.\n\nScene 5: Both on their train platforms, same deadline.\n\nWait, but the chapter summary says \"both open identical battered envelopes\" after receiving the call. So maybe after the initial call, they both are sent to the same location in their respective homes? But the user's example in the query splits the two sisters into separate scenes, each with their own summary. So perhaps:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, then leaves to go home, receives call. Then Scene 2: Caro in kitchen, gets call. Then Scene 3: Isa with Lila, Scene 4: Caro with Min. Scene 5: Both departing. That makes five.\n\nThe goal of each scene should be to introduce each sister's inciting incident, their interactions with their kids, and then the departure.\n\nEmotional beats: For Scene 1, the emotional beat is urgency and guilt. Scene 2, shock and dread. Scene 3: Tension and reluctant hope. Scene 4: Anxiety and obligation. Scene 5: Unease and anticipation.\n\nI need to make sure each scene has the correct characters. For example, Scene 1 would have Isa and maybe a patient and a doctor, but the main character is Isa. The other characters might be minor. Similarly, Scene 2, Caro is alone initially. Then in Scenes 3 and 4, the children are involved.\n\nAlso, the setting must be precise. Strasbourg ICU, Seoul kitchen, Isa's apartment, Caro's apartment, then train platforms in Strasbourg and Seoul (or maybe Caro is on a train in Korea, but the summary says opposite platforms, so Isa's in Europe, Caro's in Asia). The goal of each scene should be clear. The emotional beat should capture the main feeling.\n\nLet me draft each scene step by step.\n\nScene 1:\n- Summary: Isa is in the middle of a life-saving procedure in the ICU when she receives the call about her mother's stroke, forcing her to choose between her duty and family.\n- Characters: Isa, Teenage Patient, Dr. Weber (maybe a colleague), phone call from hospital.\nWait, the chapter summary says she's a nurse, so she's working with other staff. But main character is Isa. Maybe the patient and a colleague are present.\n\nScene 2:\n- Summary: Caro receives the same call while in her kitchen, confronting her estrangement from her mother and the implications of the stroke.\n- Characters: Caro, maybe a housekeeper? Or just her alone. But the phone call is the main action. The diplomat's wife part might have a mention of her husband, but the summary doesn't say he's present. So only Caro.\n\nScene 3:\n- Summary: Isa returns home, opens the envelope, finds the map half, red circle, sticky note. She convinces Lila to join her, using the chicken promise.\n- Characters: Isa, Lila, maybe a reference to the mother but not present. Emotional beat: Nostalgia, resentment.\n\nScene 4:\n- Summary: Caro returns home, opens the envelope, finds the same items. She convinces Min to go, uses the diplomatic pouches and kimchi trade.\n- Characters: Caro, Min, maybe a conductor in the next scene? Wait, the summary says she trades kimchi for a conductor's blind eye. So maybe Scene 4 is Caro with Min, and Scene 5 is her at the train station with the conductor.\n\nWait, but the chapter summary says Isa bribes Lila and Caro trades kimchi. So perhaps:\n\nScene 3: Isa and Lila at home, negotiating.\n\nScene 4: Caro and Min at home, negotiating.\n\nScene 5: Isa on the train platform with Lila; Caro on her platform with Min? No, because they are traveling separately. Wait, Isa is dragging her child, so Lila goes with her. Caro is dragging Min. So each mother is traveling with their child. Then Scene 5 would be both departing with their children. But the chapter summary says \"each sister drags a reluctant child\" so the children are coming along. So the fifth scene would be both on their respective trains with their children. But since the user wants each scene to be in a single setting, maybe Scene 5 is Isa at the station with Lila, and Scene 6 Caro at her station. Wait, but the user asked for exactly 5 scenes. Hmm. Wait, the chapter summary says \"by dawn, both women are on opposite platforms, clutching half a map...\" So they are both departing. But how to represent this in two different scenes? But the user wants five scenes in total. So perhaps in Scene 5, we have both platforms described separately, but each scene should be a single setting. So no. Each scene must be a single setting. Therefore, Scene 5 could be Isa at the train platform, and Scene 6 Caro's platform, but the user wants five. So maybe in the fifth scene, we have parallel cuts between both platforms. But according to the instructions, each scene is a single bullet point. The example given in the query has Scene 1 and Scene 2 as separate, so the same applies here. So perhaps we need to split the departure into two scenes, but user said exactly 5. Therefore, maybe the fifth scene is both platforms as a single scene. But that might not be right. Alternatively, each sister's departure is a separate scene, but perhaps the fifth scene combines the departure moments in a parallel way. Or maybe the fifth scene is Isa's departure, and the fourth is Caro's? Wait, no. Let me re-examine the chapter summary.\n\nThe chapter summary says that Isa and Caro each open their envelopes, then prepare their children. Then by dawn, they're on opposite platforms. So perhaps:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, gets call.\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen, gets call.\nScene 3: Isa with Lila, convincing her.\nScene 4: Caro with Min, convincing him.\nScene 5: Both at their platforms, departing.\n\nSo Scene 5 is two different settings but the same time, each sister in their location. But each scene must be a single setting. So perhaps Scene 5 is Isa's departure, and Scene 4 Caro's departure? But the summary includes both. Wait, user's example in the query's chapter summary has Scene 1 and 2 as Isa and Caro's separate moments, so the outline should have each scene as a single bullet point, each with their own setting. So Scene 5 would have to be one of the sisters at the platform. Then maybe Scene 5 is Isa's departure, but where's Caro's departure?\n\nWait, the chapter summary says \"both women are on opposite platforms\" by dawn. So perhaps Scene 5 is a single scene showing both. But in writing scenes, you can't have two different settings in one scene. So maybe the user is okay with a parallel scene structure. But according to the instructions, each scene must have a single setting. Therefore, perhaps the fifth scene is Isa at Strasbourg station, and then the fourth scene is Caro at Seoul's station. But then how many scenes? Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the user's example outline in the query has two scenes, each in different locations. So the user wants five scenes total, each with their own bullet points. Each scene must be a single setting, so the departure of each sister would be separate. But the chapter summary says they end up on opposite platforms. So perhaps Scene 5 is Isa's departure, and Scene 4 Caro's departure. But how many scenes are needed. Let's outline:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, call comes.\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen, call comes.\nScene 3: Isa with Lila, convincing her.\nScene 4: Caro with Min, convincing him.\nScene 5: Both at their platforms, departing.\n\nBut Scene 5 would need to be two different settings. So maybe the user allows a scene to cover both platforms in a single scene, but the bullet points should be a single setting. Hmm, but the example the user provided in their query (the one they want me to follow) has Scene 1 and Scene 2 as separate, so each scene is a single setting. Therefore, the outline should have each sister's departure as separate scenes. But since the chapter summary says \"by dawn\" both are on the platforms, maybe the fifth scene can be a single setting for both. No, that's conflicting. Alternatively, Scene 5 can be Isa at Strasbourg platform, and Scene 4 Caro's preparation with Min. Then Scene 5 is Isa's departure, and Scene 4 is Caro with Min. Wait, the user's chapter summary says Isa packs, forges note, bribes Lila; Caro stuffs passport, promises Min, kimchi trade. Then both on platforms. So perhaps:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU during emergency, gets call.\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen, gets call.\nScene 3: Isa at home with Lila, bribing her.\nScene 4: Caro at home with Min, convincing him, kimchi trade.\nScene 5: Both sisters at their respective platforms.\n\nBut Scene 5 must be a single setting. So perhaps Scene 5 is Isa at Strasbourg station, and the Caro's station is Scene 4's setting. Wait, but Scene 4's setting is home. Then Scene 5 would be both departing from their respective stations. But how to have two settings in one scene. Maybe the user allows that, but markdown bullet points would require each scene to have one setting. Therefore, the fifth scene must be one of the platforms. But the chapter summary says both are on opposite platforms. So perhaps the user wants the final scene to be a parallel moment, but described as a single scene? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fifth scene is Isa's departure, and the fourth is Caro's. But then the chapter summary indicates both are on platforms. Hmm, perhaps the user is okay with the fifth scene being two platforms as a single scene, but that's not typical. Alternatively, the outline can have Scene 5 as Isa's platform and Scene 6 as Caro's, but the user wants exactly five. So perhaps the departure is split into two scenes, but that would exceed five. Therefore, the correct approach is to have each sister's departure as separate scenes, but since the user wants five, we need to fit all into five.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says Isa and Caro each open the envelopes. So Scenes 3 and 4 would be each sister opening their envelope and preparing. Then Scene 5 is both departing.\n\nBut how to structure Scene 5's setting? It can't have two places. Maybe the user is okay with a \"parallel\" scene, but in the outline, perhaps the setting is listed as two places.\n\nAlternatively, the emotional beat for Scene 5 would be both of their feelings as they depart. So maybe:\n\nScene 5:\n- Setting: Strasbourg Train Station and Seoul Train Station\nBut that's not standard. Alternatively, focus on one of them, but the summary says both. Hmm, perhaps the user expects the final scene to capture both departures in one bullet point, but each scene is supposed to be a single setting. Therefore, maybe the fifth scene is Isa at Strasbourg station and Lila with her, and the fourth scene is Caro at home with Min, and Scene 5 is Caro at Seoul station. Wait, but the chapter summary says \"both women are on opposite platforms\" so each is alone? Or with their kids? The book description says each drags a reluctant child. So they are traveling with their children. So Scene 5 would be Isa and Lila at Strasbourg station, and Caro and Min on their own platform. But each scene must be in one setting. So the outline would have:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU.\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\nScene 3: Isa with Lila at home.\nScene 4: Caro with Min at home.\nScene 5: Isa and Lila at Strasbourg station, Caro and Min at Seoul station.\n\nBut how to represent this in a single Scene 5? Maybe the setting is both stations. But the user might expect each scene to be from one location. Alternatively, since the sisters are moving independently, each of their departure scenes is a separate scene. But with five total, perhaps the fifth scene is Isa at the station, and the fourth Caro with Min. Wait, the chapter summary says Isa bribes Lila, then she's on the platform. Caro deals with Min and then is on the platform. So each mother's preparation with child is a separate scene. Then Scene 5 is each departing. But user wants exactly five scenes. So perhaps Scene 5 is Isa on the platform with Lila, and Scene 4 is Caro with Min, and Scene 5 also includes Caro's platform. No, this is getting confusing. Let me check the chapter summary again.\n\nThe chapter summary says:\n\n\"Both women are on opposite platforms, clutching half a map and the same impossible deadline.\"\n\nTherefore, the final scene in the chapter is both of them at their respective platforms. But how to represent that in a single scene? Maybe it's a dual timeline moment. But in a book chapter, you can have parallel scene cuts. However, the outline should list each scene as a separate bullet. So perhaps the user expects Scene 5 to be both departing, but each in their own setting. So:\n\nScene 5:\n- Summary: Isa and Caro board different trains, each with their child, beginning their journey toward the eclipse.\n- Characters: Isa, Lila, Caro, Min.\n- Setting: Strasbourg Train Station and Seoul Train Station.\n- Goal: To show the parallel journeys beginning.\n- Emotional Beat: Anticipation, unresolved tension.\n\nBut this might not be accurate since they are in different locations. Alternatively, split into two scenes. But user wants exactly five. Hmm. Maybe the outline should have Scene 5 as Isa at Strasbourg station and Scene 6 as Caro at Seoul, but the user wants five. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to have each sister's departure as part of the same scene, even if in different settings. Or maybe the user is okay with combining into a single scene with two settings. Alternatively, perhaps the final scene is written as two separate scenes, but the user said five. Therefore, the outline must have five scenes. So perhaps the fifth scene is a single bullet point that covers both platforms, even though it's two settings. But that's against the usual scene structure. Alternatively, maybe the final scene is Isa's departure and the next chapter starts with Caro's, but the user wants all in Chapter 1's outline. So I need to make a judgment here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the departure is two separate scenes (Scene 4 and 5), but user's chapter summary includes both in the same sentence. Let me try:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa with Lila, negotiating.\n\nScene 4: Caro with Min, negotiating.\n\nScene 5: Both Isa and Caro at their respective platforms, departing.\n\nSo Scene 5 is two separate moments but summarized in one scene. But strictly, each scene should have one setting. So perhaps the user wants each sister's departure to be in their own scene. That would make five scenes total. Wait, five scenes total for the chapter. So:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa at home with Lila.\n\nScene 4: Caro at home with Min.\n\nScene 5: Isa and Lila at Strasbourg platform, Caro and Min on a ferry or train in Asia?\n\nWait, the chapter summary says Isa uses slow trains, night ferries, closed borders. But in the chapter summary's end, they are on opposite platforms. The book description says they race across two continents, so maybe Caro is leaving Seoul, perhaps taking a train or flight.\n\nBut the user's chapter summary says \"by dawn, both women are on opposite platforms\". So Scene 5 would be Isa on a platform in Strasbourg, Caro on a platform in Seoul. But each scene must be a single setting. Therefore, perhaps Scene 5 is split into two scenes. But user wants five. Therefore, I need to choose one for Scene 5. But the chapter summary ends with both on platforms. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user example in the query shows:\n\nScene 1:\n* Summary: [Scene summary here]\n* Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\n* Setting: [Scene setting]\n* Goal: [Scene goal]\n* Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\n\nSo each scene is a single setting. Therefore, the outline must have five scenes, each in a single setting. So the departure of each sister must be in separate scenes. But the chapter summary says \"both women are on opposite platforms\" by dawn. So if we have five scenes:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa at home with Lila.\n\nScene 4: Caro at home with Min.\n\nScene 5: Isa and Caro departing on their respective platforms.\n\nBut Scene 5 would have two settings. Alternatively, Scene 5 is Isa's departure, Scene 4 is Caro's departure. Then total scenes would be five. Wait, but the chapter summary says both are on the platforms. So perhaps:\n\nScene 5: Isa at Strasbourg platform with Lila.\n\nBut where does Caro's departure fit? Then the outline would have:\n\nScene 1: Isa's ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro's kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa with Lila.\n\nScene 4: Caro with Min.\n\nScene 5: Caro at Seoul station.\n\nBut then the summary's \"opposite platforms\" would be covered in Scene 5 and another. Wait, but the user wants exactly five. Therefore, perhaps the final scene is Isa and Caro each on their own platform, but described in one bullet point. However, each scene should have one setting. Maybe the user is okay with a scene that alternates between the two, but in the outline, perhaps each sister's scene is separate. So:\n\nScene 5:\n\n* Setting: Strasbourg Train Station\n\nBut then where is Caro's departure? Alternatively, the user's chapter summary includes both in the same sentence, but the outline must have five scenes, each in a single setting. Therefore, the outline should have:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa with Lila at home.\n\nScene 4: Caro with Min at home.\n\nScene 5: Isa and Lila at Strasbourg station; Caro and Min at Seoul station.\n\nBut each scene's setting must be a single location. To resolve this, maybe Scene 5 is two parallel scenes. But user wants exactly five. So perhaps we can have Scene 5 as Isa at Strasbourg, and Scene 4 as Caro at home. Then the final scene is Isa departing, and the previous one Caro's preparation. But the chapter summary says they both end up on the platforms. The user's chapter summary mentions both, so the outline should reflect that. Therefore, to include both departures, perhaps the fifth scene is Isa's departure, and the fourth Caro's. No, wait:\n\nScene 5 must be both, but how? Alternatively, the final scene is Isa and Caro each in their own station, but in the outline, each scene is separate. So the user's example in the query has two scenes for two characters. So in this case, the outline would have five scenes, each focused on one sister's perspective. Wait, but the chapter summary starts with Isa, then Caro twelve minutes earlier. So Scene 2 would be flash back to twelve minutes earlier. Then the subsequent scenes are chronological. But maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, the scenes are:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, gets call.\n\nScene 2: Caro in Seoul kitchen, gets call.\n\nScene 3: Isa opens the envelope, interacts with Lila.\n\nScene 4: Caro opens the envelope, interacts with Min.\n\nScene 5: Both departing from their stations.\n\nBut each scene must be a single setting. So Scene 5 can either be Isa's station or Caro's. But the chapter summary ends with both there. So perhaps the fifth scene is Isa's departure and the goal is to start her journey, and then Caro's departure is another scene. But user wants five. Therefore, maybe the user's example allows combining the two in Scene 5 with a dual setting.\n\nAlternatively, the user might not mind that Scene 5's setting is \"Strasbourg Train Station and Seoul Train Station\" to show parallel action. Let me proceed with that, even if a bit unconventional.\n\nNow, the emotional beat for Scene 5 would be \"anticipation and unresolved tension\" as they start their journey. The goal is to show their parallel departure and commitment to the journey despite their issues.\n\nAlso, the characters in each scene:\n\nScene 1: Isa, Teenage Patient, Dr. Weber (maybe, to show her professional setting), phone call from hospital (but if she's already in ICU, then the call is from her mother's hospital in another location. Wait, Isa is in Strasbourg's ICU. The call is about her mother's stroke. So maybe the call is from the hospital where her mother is, but in the scene, the characters present are Isa and her patient, and maybe a nurse or doctor relaying the phone call. But the user's example might not require all characters, just the main ones. So perhaps only Isa, and the patient as background.\n\nSame for Caro: only Caro in Scene 2. Then in Scenes 3 and 4, their children are involved.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nScene 1: Isa in ICU, call about mother.\n\nScene 2: Caro in Seoul kitchen, same call.\n\nScene 3: Isa at home with Lila, convincing her.\n\nScene 4: Caro at home with Min, convincing him.\n\nScene 5: Isa and Lila at Strasbourg station, Caro and Min at Seoul station.\n\nBut Scene 5's setting would have to be two different ones. Alternatively, Scene 5 is Isa at Strasbourg station, Scene 6 is Caro's, but user wants five. Therefore, perhaps the final scene is Isa's departure, and the Caro's departure is omitted? No, the chapter summary mentions both. Therefore, the user wants both in the outline. So maybe Scene 5 is Isa's platform, Scene 4 is Caro's platform. But then how to fit the preparation with their children.\n\nWait, the chapter summary says Isa bribes Lila, packs, etc., and Caro does her stuff. So Scenes 3 and 4 are the preparation with their children. Scene 5 is both on platforms.\n\nSo, Scene 1: Isa in ICU.\n\nScene 2: Caro in kitchen.\n\nScene 3: Isa with Lila at home.\n\nScene 4: Caro with Min at home.\n\nScene 5: Isa and Caro at their respective platforms.\n\nBut Scene 5's setting would be two places. Alternatively, each sister's platform is one of the first two scenes, but that doesn't fit. Maybe Scene 5 is a single setting but both platforms are described in the summary. The user's example in the query's chapter summary says by dawn they are on opposite platforms. So the outline's Scene 5 must include both.\n\nBut according to the format, each scene must have one setting. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, or expects two settings in one scene. Alternatively, the outline can have Scene 5 as Isa at Strasbourg station and Scene 4 as Caro's departure. No, conflicting with the preparation scenes.\n\nAlternatively, the fifth scene is Isa and Lila boarding a train in Strasbourg, and Caro and Min boarding a ferry or train elsewhere. The setting for Scene 5 could be both a train station and a ferry? No, but the book description mentions night ferries and slow trains. But in the chapter summary, they are on opposite platforms. So the setting is train platforms.\n\nTherefore, to comply with the user's request, I'll proceed to outline five scenes, each in a single setting, alternating between Isa and Caro, with the fifth scene being both on their platforms. But each scene must have one setting. So Scene 5's setting will be both platforms. It's a bit of a stretch, but perhaps acceptable for the outline.\n\nNow, let's structure each scene properly:\n\nScene 1:\n- Isa in ICU during emergency, gets the call about her mother's stroke.\n- Characters: Isa, Teenage Patient, Dr. Weber (colleague), Phone.\n- Setting: ICU at Strasbourg Hospital.\n- Goal: Introduce Isa's high-pressure life and the catalyst event (mother's stroke).\n- Emotional Beat: Urgency, guilt (duty vs. family).\n\nScene 2:\n- Caro in her kitchen, receives the same call.\n- Characters: Caro, Phone, maybe a background character like a housekeeper or her husband, but summary doesn't mention. So just Caro.\n- Setting: Caro's darkened kitchen in Seoul high-rise.\n- Goal: Establish Caro's disconnected life and the inciting incident.\n- Emotional Beat: Shock, disconnection.\n\nScene 3:\n- Isa opens the envelope, finds map half, red circle, note. She decides to go, forges a doctor's note, convinces Lila.\n- Characters: Isa, Lila.\n- Setting: Isa's apartment in Strasbourg.\n- Emotional Beat: Nostalgia, resentment, determination.\n\nScene 4:\n- Caro opens the envelope, same items. She stuffs passport, convinces Min, trades kimchi with conductor.\nWait, the conductor interaction is part of her preparation. So maybe she's at home when she convinces Min, then the kimchi trade happens later. But the chapter summary says she trades kimchi for the conductor's blind eye. So perhaps the conductor is in Scene 4. Or is that part of her journey's prep? The summary says she does that when preparing. So maybe:\n\nScene 4: Caro at home with Min, then interacting with conductor at home or at the station? Hmm. The chapter summary says she trades kimchi for conductor's help. If the conductor is part of this scene, then the setting would be at the station. But if Scene 4 is at home, then the conductor isn't there. To keep within five scenes, perhaps the conductor is a separate scene. But user wants five. Maybe the conductor is a minor element, and the focus is Caro and Min at home. The kimchi trade could be a quick mention in the summary.\n\nScene 4:\n- Summary: Caro explains the trip to Min, who's anxious, promises it'll be a family legend. She prepares passport and kimchi for the conductor's help.\n- Setting: Caro's apartment in Seoul.\n- Characters: Caro, Min.\n- Goal: Establish Caro's strained relationship with Min and her resourcefulness.\n- Emotional Beat: Pressure, reluctant responsibility.\n\nScene 5:\n- Summary: Both Isa and Caro arrive at their platforms with their children, each holding their map half. They board separate trains, beginning their journey.\n- Setting: Strasbourg Train Station and Seoul Train Station.\n- Characters: Isa, Lila, Caro, Min (but each pair in their own location)\n- Goal: Parallel departure, emphasize the deadline.\n- Emotional Beat: Unease, anticipation.\n\nBut again, setting here is two places. Maybe the user allows that. Alternatively, split into two scenes. But the user wants five. So I'll proceed with this structure.\n\nI need to make sure that each scene's goal is clear. Also, the emotional beats should vary and show the different feelings of the sisters.\n\nI think this should cover all the points. Now, time to write the markdown bullet points accordingly.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":769,"completion_tokens":9366,"total_tokens":10135}}
