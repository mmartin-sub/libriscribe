She stumbles to answer, barefoot on cold tile, her mind still fogged by sleep as the nurse’s urgent Korean cuts through the silence.\n\nThe phone rattles against the cheap melamine nightstand like a trapped cicada. Once, twice, three times before Caro’s arm shoots from beneath the quilt, fingers groping across the clutter of graphite pencils and half-finished mandalas. The screen’s blue glare knifes her corneas: 4:12 a.m., unknown caller.\n\n“Yoboseyo.” Her voice cracks on the last syllable, dry as the charcoal she’d been smudging into moonlight at 2 a.m.\n\n“Songssi-eyo?” A woman’s voice, clipped, medical. “Samsung Medical. Harper Song-ssi—unmyeong… emergency.”\n\nThe Korean splinters Caro’s chest before her brain translates. Harper. Thirty-three weeks. Emergency.\n\nShe’s on her feet before the next word arrives, tiles aching-cold under her arches, the kind of cold that climbs bone like ivy. The apartment smells of instant ramen and turpentine; yesterday’s rain still drips from the kitchen eaves, each drop tapping Morse code against the tin sill.\n\nThe nurse keeps talking, faster now, syllables clicking like typewriter keys. Caro’s Korean unspools sluggishly, half-dreamt. “Cesarean consent… bleeding… mother unconscious… father unknown…”\n\nCaro’s free hand finds the counter edge. A coffee mug topples—clay shattering, black ring spreading across yesterday’s sketches. The fragments look like continents after tectonic divorce.\n\n“Nae,” she whispers, then louder, “Yes. I understand. I’m—she’s my niece. I’ll sign. Whatever you need.”\n\nThe nurse exhales, relief crackling over the line. “Come quickly. Neonatal team assembling.”\n\nThe call ends. Silence pours back in, heavier than before. Caro stands barefoot in the blue glow of the microwave clock, pulse knocking at her throat. She hasn’t seen Harper since the girl was sixteen, hasn’t spoken to Isa in almost that long. Her last text to her sister—Happy Birthday, sorry I missed it—still sits undelivered because Isa changed numbers without telling her.\n\nShe looks down. Her right hand grips the phone so hard the case creaks. Her left clutches something else entirely—her old sketchbook, the one with the strawberry-stained toddler on the cover, pulled from the counter pile by instinct. The spine is warped, corners soft as felt, but Harper’s two-year-old grin still glimmers under layers of graphite fingerprints.\n\nOutside, neon crosses the Han River blink like faulty lighthouses. Somewhere across the water, Harper’s body is splitting open too soon.\n\nCaro’s knees buckle. She catches herself on the fridge door, magnets scattering—Ohio State, a Polaroid of her and Isa at seventeen, arms slung over each other like sailors on leave. The photo skitters under the radiator, face-down.\n\nShe should call Isa. She should pack. She should—\n\nA siren wails along the boulevard below, dopplering into the distance. The sound lifts her, propels her toward the bedroom. Toward the ferry schedule taped above the desk. Toward whatever lies across the strait at dawn.\n\nShe doesn’t notice she’s bleeding until a crimson bead blooms on her big toe—shards of the broken mug. She studies it, detached, then wipes it on the hem of her T-shirt, leaving a small rust comma beside a faded silkscreen of Van Gogh’s sunflowers.\n\nThe sketchbook stays in her hand. Passport, talisman, indictment. She has no idea how to tell Isa that Harper is even in Korea, let alone that her child might be born tonight, two months early, on another continent.\n\nCaro pulls the apartment door shut behind her. The hallway smells of kimchi and bleach and rain. She doesn’t lock up. Somewhere inside, the radiator hisses, sounding exactly like a woman trying not to scream.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":676,"completion_tokens":915,"total_tokens":1591,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
