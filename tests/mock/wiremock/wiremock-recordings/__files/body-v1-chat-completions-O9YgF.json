Etienne steps through first, coat unbuttoned, scarf trailing like a comet’s tail. In one hand he carries two paper cups so carefully the lids don’t click; in the other, a pair of knitted socks the color of tide-pool anemones. His cheeks are wind-scraped, eyes puffed from the red-eye flight, but the instant he sees Isa—barefoot on the vinyl, toes curled against the floor—his face folds into the same soft apology he has worn since Siberia.  \n\nHe crosses the waiting room in four deliberate strides, places the cups on the arm of Caro’s chair without looking at her, and kneels in front of Isa as if the scuffed linoleum is cathedral marble.  \n“Chérie,” he whispers, French r scraping like a match, “I was already in the air when the embassy called. I should have been there when they stamped you out.” He lifts the socks. “Made these on the plane. Flight attendant thought I was knitting a bomb.”  \n\nIsa’s laugh is a small, wet click. She lets him slide the wool over her icy feet, fingers trembling against his wrist. Over his shoulder she sees the doors open again.  \n\nDavid enters alone. No coat, just a zip-up hoodie pulled over hospital scrubs he hasn’t changed out of since yesterday. The divorce papers ride in the inside pocket; the rectangle bulges like a slow-beating heart. He stops two paces inside, scans the room, finds Caro with the sketchbook balanced on her knees and the untouched espresso steaming beside her. He does not look at Isa.  \n\nCaro lifts her head. For a moment the only sound is the monitors on the other side of the glass, a language of beeps translating the baby’s every inhale.  \n\nDavid’s voice is level, almost managerial. “Harper still out?”  \n\n“Yeah,” Caro says. “They’re weaning the vent. He’ll wake soon.”  \n\n“Good.” David folds his arms so the pocket flattens against his ribs. “I brought the—” He stops, glances at Etienne still on his knees, at Isa’s newly socked feet. “—the forms. When you’re ready.”  \n\nEtienne stands slowly. He offers David one of the espressos. David takes it but doesn’t drink; the heat bleeds through the corrugated sleeve and steams against his palm.  \n\nBetween the men, the sisters sit like two stones in a shallow river. Caro’s thumbnail worries the corner of the sketchbook. Isa’s hand hovers above Etienne’s sleeve, not quite touching, as if the cloth is electrified.  \n\n“You flew all night?” David asks Etienne, polite as a hotel concierge.  \n\n“Paris–Seoul direct. Eight hours of turbulence and babies crying.” Etienne’s mouth quirks. “I was one of them, I think.”  \n\nDavid nods, eyes on the baby through the glass. His reflection hovers over the isolette like a ghost in scrubs. “We were three miles away,” he says, almost to himself. “Whole time. Didn’t know the kid existed until yesterday.”  \n\nCaro flinches. The sketchbook slides an inch off her lap before she catches it.  \n\nIsa speaks for the first time since Etienne arrived. “David, it wasn’t— We didn’t know how to tell you.”  \n\n“You told the lawyers,” he says, soft. “That part got figured out.” The paper in his pocket crackles when he breathes.  \n\nEtienne shifts, a buffer trying to form itself from French manners and jet-lagged bones. “Perhaps we could… give them a minute,” he suggests to David. “Get more coffee. Vending machines are—”  \n\n“No.” David’s gaze stays on the baby. “I’m not leaving until Harper opens his eyes. I’ve missed enough.”  \n\nSilence pools again. A nurse slips past to tap numbers into a keypad; the lock chirps like a warning.  \n\nEtienne turns to Isa, cups her elbows. “Do you want me to go?” he asks in French. The words float across the quiet like candle sparks.  \n\nShe shakes her head once, fiercely. “Stay.”  \n\nCaro watches the exchange, eyes glassy. She closes the sketchbook, presses it to her chest as if shielding her heart from ricochets. Then, deliberate, she stands and steps to David. The space between them is less than the width of the divorce papers.  \n\n“I can sign,” she says, so low the monitors almost swallow it. “But not here. Not beside that glass while our grandson fights for air.”  \n\nDavid’s jaw flexes. He draws the envelope halfway out of his pocket; the corner catches on the lining, hesitates. “Then where?” he asks.  \n\n“Outside,” Caro says. “Ten minutes. Just past the doors where it’s cold enough to feel something else.”  \n\nHe nods once. The envelope stays in his pocket.  \n\nIsa rises. Etienne’s hand slides to the small of her back, steady. The four of them form a loose constellation: two marriages orbiting the same exhausted star.  \n\nBehind them, the baby’s monitor pings a new rhythm, faster but steady. A green light blinks approval.  \n\nCaro exhales, thin and tremulous. “That’s the wean,” she says. “They’re turning the oxygen down.” She looks at Isa. “You coming?”  \n\nIsa glances at Etienne. He lifts the second espresso, presses it into her hand as if it’s a relay baton. “I’ll be right behind you,” he says.  \n\nDavid already has the door handle. Cold air curls in, carrying the first iron smell of Seoul’s winter dawn.  \n\nCaro steps over the threshold. Isa follows. The husbands hesitate half a beat, then trail after, shadows lengthening under the fluorescent corridor lights.  \n\nThe door hisses shut, muffling the monitors. Somewhere inside, a baby learns how much air his lungs can hold. Outside, four adults learn the same lesson, word by word, breath by breath, on the exact latitude where tomorrow’s light is already pooling.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":667,"completion_tokens":1372,"total_tokens":2039,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
