Isa dips her brush into a mason jar of burnt-umber tempera and swipes an exaggerated oak leaf across Harper’s forearm. The six-year-old squeals, delighted, and the sound bounces off the bead-board walls like birdsong.  \n\n“Again, Aunt Isa! Make a maple this time.”  \n\nCaro laughs from the sink, sleeves rolled to her elbows, freckles bright under the window light. “Don’t you dare turn my kid into wallpaper,” she says, but she is already tearing open a fresh packet of vermilion so her sister can oblige.  \n\nElena—nine, solemn, forever pretending to be older than he is—leans over his own sheet of butcher paper, painting a grid of precise yellow poplars. “Mom, the stalks should be symmetrical,” he says, nudging his glasses up with a paint-stained knuckle.  \n\n“Symmetry is overrated,” Caro answers, flicking a stripe of orange across the back of his hand. He startles, then grins despite himself.  \n\nIsa watches the grin bloom on her son’s face and feels the day expand around them—woodsmoke drifting in from the orchard bonfire, the faint hiss of cider mulling on the stove, Caro humming something tuneless while she rinses brushes. Everything smells of cinnamon bark and turpentine.  \n\nHarper dips her fingers into the communal jar and begins printing tiny palms along the table edge. Caro pretends to object— “We’ll never get that off before Thanksgiving”—but she presses her own hand beside Harper’s so the prints interlock, adult against child.  \n\n“Remember when we thought these were turkey tracks?” Isa says, tracing the memory with her brush. She is talking to Caro, but Harper answers anyway.  \n\n“Gobble gobble,” the girl declares, wiggling orange-smeared fingers like feathers.  \n\nElena rolls his eyes heavenward, yet he scoots closer to Harper so their papers overlap. Leaves on leaves, borders dissolving.  \n\nCaro dries her hands on a tea towel the color of ripe persimmons and drops into the chair opposite Isa. She tears a strip of paper towel, dabs at a smear of green on her sister’s cheek. “You always get more paint on yourself than the page,” she says, voice soft, the same tone she used when they were small and shared the attic bedroom with the slanted ceiling.  \n\nIsa leans into the touch, a little like a cat, a little like someone making sure the moment is real. Outside, the wind rattles the last of the sassafras leaves against the windowpanes; inside, the only sound is the wet brush whisper of color finding shape.  \n\nHarper climbs onto Caro’s lap, tucking her head beneath her mother’s chin. “Tell the one about the princess who traded her shadow for a map,” she says.  \n\n“Later,” Caro promises, pressing a kiss to the crown of dark curls. “Right now we’re making masterpieces.”  \n\nElena lifts his finished painting and holds it to the light. The leaves look almost luminous, as though they might flutter off the page. “Can we tape these to the porch windows?” he asks.  \n\nIsa glances at Caro. They have never needed words for these small negotiations; the farmhouse has always run on glances and unspoken arithmetic. Caro’s nod is so slight it might be the sun shifting, yet Isa catches it.  \n\n“Let’s do the south side first,” Isa says. “The light hits there in the afternoon.”  \n\nThey troop out—bare feet on cool floorboards, then socks hurried on, then the slam of the screen door that never quite closes unless you shoulder it. The porch boards creak under their combined weight. Harper balances on the railing, arms out like a fledgling, while Isa and Caro smooth masking tape along the edges of the paintings.  \n\nThe wind carries the smell of bruised apples from the orchard. Somewhere a crow calls once, twice. The leaves on the paper seem to echo the leaves overhead—some still clinging to branches, most strewn across the yard in bright, unapologetic decay.  \n\nCaro steps back to survey their handiwork. “We’re like stained-glass artists,” she says. “Except our glass is just… enthusiasm.”  \n\nIsa bumps her shoulder. “Your enthusiasm. I’m the irresponsible one who never tapes the corners straight.”  \n\n“True,” Caro answers, but she is smiling at the crooked maple leaf rather than correcting it.  \n\nHarper slides down from the railing, leaving tiny handprints of paint along the peeling white balustrade. She grabs Elena’s wrist. “Race you to the tire swing.” They pound across the yard, red leaves kicking up under their sneakers.  \n\nCaro and Isa remain on the porch. The sun is slipping behind the sugar maples now, turning the sky the color of the vermilion jar. Caro’s hand finds Isa’s, paint tacky between their palms.  \n\n“Do you think they’ll remember afternoons like this?” Isa asks. The question surprises her; it feels almost like rehearsing a line for a future play.  \n\nCaro squeezes once. “They’ll remember the smell of cider. And the way you let Harper paint your face the year she went as autumn for Halloween.”  \n\nIsa laughs, but it catches on something small and sharp in her throat. She turns her wrist so their fingers interlace properly. “Stay for dinner?”  \n\n“I am dinner,” Caro says. “You’re the one who burns grilled cheese.”  \n\n“I meant metaphorically.”  \n\nCaro’s eyes soften. “I know.”  \n\nBehind them, Harper shrieks from the swing— “Higher!”—and Elena's laughter rings out, rare and bright. The sound stitches the evening together at its fraying edges.  \n\nInside, the kettle begins to whistle. Caro tugs Isa back toward the door. Their joined hands swing once, twice, then let go naturally as they cross the threshold—Caro to the stove, Isa to the stack of letters waiting on the counter, a single Strasbourg postmark peeking from the bottom like a secret trying to be born.\n\nThe screen door wheezes shut. The wind scatters a handful of real leaves across the porch, past the taped-up masterpieces, and for one crystalline moment the painted leaves and the living leaves are indistinguishable—until dusk separates them, color from color, future from past.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":552,"completion_tokens":1419,"total_tokens":1971,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
