The structure looms like a tomb, its rusted antennae clawing at the sky.\n\nThe Dodge’s headlights died and silence rolled in on the wind, thick with the smell of iron and river ice. Caro killed the engine. The last few flakes hissed against the hood as if the truck itself were cooling off from the sprint across the border.\n\nIsa stepped out first, boots crunching through the glazed snow. Her breath came out in ragged clouds, each one a white flag. She didn’t look back at Caro—looking back felt like permission to hesitate. Instead she stared at the listening post.\n\nIt rose from the riverbank like something coughed up from the earth’s gut: corrugated walls the color of dried blood, windows punched out and black, antennae leaning at sick angles that reminded her of broken fingers after a bombing. One of the dishes still spun, squeaking faintly, as though trying to tune in a lullaby no one sang anymore.\n\nCaro’s door slammed. The sound cracked down the valley, startling a murder of crows from the scrub. They wheeled once over the structure, then scattered toward the bruised horizon where the Tumen glimmered—half water, half mirror, half blade.\n\n“Thirty-eight minutes,” Caro said, voice hoarse from the drive. She checked the cheap GPS watch strapped over her glove. “If the file’s still on the countdown.”\n\nIsa’s fingers were already trembling, but not from cold. “He said sunrise. It’s coming.”\n\nThe sky behind them bled from charcoal to gunmetal; somewhere behind the clouds the sun was lifting itself like a coin someone had lost at the bottom of a well. Dawn here never promised warmth—only clarity, and that was the worst part.\n\nCaro started toward the post. Her parka rasped against itself, the nylon loud in the hush. “You smell that?” she asked without slowing.\n\n“Cordite,” Isa answered. “And diesel. Someone’s been here.”\n\nCaro’s jaw twitched—the same tic she’d had as a kid when their mother caught them sneaking out. Isa remembered it from a lifetime ago, the two of them crawling across rooftop tiles in Busan, chasing rumors. Now they were chasing ghosts.\n\nThey reached the perimeter fence. A section had been peeled open with bolt cutters, edges bright with fresh metal. Through the gap, the path to the door had been trampled—single set of prints, small, deliberate. Not soldiers. One person, leading them exactly where they needed to go.\n\nCaro ducked first. Isa followed, snagging her sleeve on a twist of barbed wire. A bead of blood welled, black against the gray wool. She didn’t pause to staunch it; the pain felt deserved.\n\nUp close, the post exhaled rot: rust, wet concrete, and something underneath it like spoiled milk. Isa tasted bile. On the far side, the river whispered against ice plates, a wet knock of stone on stone. Somewhere under that sound, she swore she could hear Luna humming—one of the old Spanish lullabies Isa had sung to her when the nightmares came. A hallucination born of fear, but it lodged behind her ribs all the same.\n\nCaro pressed her palm to the metal door. “Locked from the inside,” she muttered. “He wants us to knock.”\n\nIsa’s throat was raw. “Luna?” she called, the name cracking. “Min?”\n\nOnly wind answered, sliding across the corrugated roof like a hand looking for a throat.\n\nCaro slid the crowbar from under her coat. “We do this fast. Get them, get out, let the river take the rest.” She wedged the bar under the latch. Metal shrieked. The door jerked outward an inch, exhaling a breath of stale heat and something sweeter—coppery. Blood or wires or both.\n\nIsa flinched. “He’s inside with them. He wants a show.”\n\n“Then we give him one.” Caro’s voice was flat, the way surgeons speak when the patient’s already on the table and the heart is slowing. She heaved the bar again. The latch snapped with a sound like a collarbone breaking.\n\nThe door swung inward on groaning hinges. Beyond lay a throat of darkness stabbed by a single blue laptop glow. On the screen, the lullaby line pulsed—피는 물보다 진하다, mais l’eau efface tout—like a heartbeat.\n\nCaro stepped over the threshold first. Isa caught her sleeve.\n\n“Whatever we choose,” Isa whispered, “we do it together this time.”\n\nCaro’s eyes—black as the river water—met hers. For the first time since they’d left the safehouse, something unclenched in her face. Not hope, exactly, but the distant cousin of it: recognition.\n\n“Together,” Caro echoed.\n\nBehind them, the sky brightened a fraction, a gray knife sliding between the clouds. Ahead, the laptop waited, and the children beyond it. The river kept its slow, endless conversation with the ice.\n\nCaro tightened her grip on Isa’s hand. They crossed the threshold together.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":682,"completion_tokens":1118,"total_tokens":1800,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
