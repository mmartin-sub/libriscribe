The lullaby’s melody fades into smoke, and the Red Cross report floods the internet.\n\nThe river groaned like old iron under their weight. Each footstep cracked the glaze of ice, sending spider-veins racing ahead of them. Isa’s boots slipped first; Caro’s shoulder steadied her before she went down with Luna on her back. The six-year-old’s arms were locked so tight around Isa’s neck that every breath tasted of the child’s fear—metallic, like pennies held too long in the mouth.\n\nBehind them, the listening post roared awake. A single tongue of orange licked up the eastern wall, catching the dry antennae, turning the dead trees into sudden torches. The heat reached them across forty yards of wind, enough to warm the backs of their necks. Luna lifted her head.\n\n“Mama’s humming stopped,” she whispered.\n\nIsa hadn’t realized the lullaby had been playing from the shack’s tin speaker until the moment it died. Now only the wind stayed, scraping across the flats like a bow across rusted strings.\n\nCaro adjusted Min on her hip. The boy’s cheek was swollen where tape had torn free; his eyes were wide, reflecting the inferno they’d left. “Keep them forward,” she told Isa, voice smoke-rough. “Don’t look back.”\n\nBut Isa did. She watched the roof cave inward, sparks spiraling up into the iron dawn. In the fire’s bright throat she saw the laptop, screen cracked like an eye, the two phantom buttons now molten plastic. Somewhere in the collapsing roof, the last copy of the 1996 report—her mother’s careful omissions, Caro’s grandfather’s signature—crackled into ash. Yet the internet had already inhaled it; she imagined servers humming in Seoul, Geneva, Pyongyang, mirrors multiplying faster than censors could blink.\n\nA boom rolled across the water, deep as war drums. The concussion shoved them forward. Ice buckled ahead, a dark seam opening. Caro didn’t hesitate; she stepped onto the floating slab and kept walking, Min’s legs clamped around her waist like a small, stubborn koala. Isa followed, Luna’s weight settling heavier with each yard, the child’s breaths shallow but steady.\n\nMidstream, the river narrowed to the width of a two-lane road. Across the far bank, the Russian side waited: birch trunks ghost-white against the gray sky, nothing else. No border guards, no flashing lights. Just silence and the morning that refused to bloom.\n\nLuna stirred. “I can walk.”\n\nIsa knelt; the ice kissed her knees through the ripped fabric. Luna slid down, fingers still hooked in Isa’s sleeve. Min wriggled free of Caro and took his cousin’s hand. Two small figures in borrowed coats, stamping to keep blood moving.\n\nCaro’s breath fogged between them. “We’ll need to move fast once we hit the trees. They’ll send drones.”\n\nIsa nodded, but her legs felt packed with sand. She looked at the fire again. The shack was a black rib cage now, beams glowing like coals in a forge. The lullaby was truly gone; only the wind carried its last note, stretched until it snapped.\n\nCaro touched Isa’s elbow. “We chose right.”\n\n“We chose,” Isa echoed. The distinction felt important.\n\nTogether they started up the far bank, boots breaking through crusted snow. Behind them the river kept sliding east, carrying chips of burning wood and a curl of melody no one would ever catch. Ahead, the birch trunks parted like theater curtains on a stage still empty.\n\nLuna began to hum—not the lullaby, but something brighter, half-forgotten from a playground long ago. Min joined on the off-beat. Their small voices braided in the cold air, a new thread to follow.\n\nIsa and Caro walked behind them, shoulder to shoulder now, no one leading, no one following. The fire’s glow faded against their backs; the children’s silhouettes sharpened in the rising light. When they reached the first tree line, the sky cracked open a seam of pale silver, and the river behind them kept rolling, indifferent, carrying the last of their secrets out to sea.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":666,"completion_tokens":912,"total_tokens":1578,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
