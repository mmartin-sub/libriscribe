Isa’s son and Caro’s daughter, strangers bound only by blood, vanish from a Seoul subway platform during a student-exchange trip gone wrong. Riven by guilt over years of silence, the sisters abandon the lives that kept them apart—Isa leaves her trauma ward, Caro steps out of her immaculate apartment—and embark on converging odysseys. Isa books a last-minute courier flight; Caro trades her minivan for a borrowed motorcycle and a tattered city map. Each mile unearths buried memories of their own mother’s disappearance decades earlier, forcing them to confront the fear that history is repeating itself. From Strasbourg’s twilight canals to Seoul’s neon arteries, the sisters race toward a reunion that will demand more than geographic closure: they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice to stitch their fractured family back together—before the children, and each other, are lost forever.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":290,"total_tokens":480,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
