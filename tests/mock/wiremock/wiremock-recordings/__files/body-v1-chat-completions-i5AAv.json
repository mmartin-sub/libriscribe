Caro steps out first. The cold snaps at her cheeks and steals her breath like a thief, but she walks until her sneakers touch the painted yellow line someone has drawn across the concrete—thirty-seven degrees, thirty-three minutes north of the equator. The marker is almost invisible in the half-dark, just a thin vein of color between two worlds.\n\nBehind her, Isa’s bare feet slap softly. The frost should sting, yet she doesn’t flinch. A single gull wheels overhead, wings skimming the turquoise edge of the sky. The city below is still asleep, windows lit like scattered embers, the Han River a black ribbon threaded with gold.\n\nCaro sets the sketchbook on the parapet. The spine creaks; the pages smell faintly of cedar and old ink. She hasn’t opened it since the night she left Paris, the night Isa left everything behind. Now she flips past sketches of rooftops, of bridges, of Isa’s face at twenty-three, half-erased by time. She stops at the first blank page. The paper shivers in the wind.\n\nIsa digs in the pocket of her coat—Caro’s coat, actually, borrowed from the back of a chair downstairs—and produces a single black pen. The cap is cracked; the clip long gone. She offers it grip-first.\n\nCaro doesn’t take it yet. “I don’t know how to start,” she says. Her voice is raw, colorless.\n\n“You already did,” Isa answers. “You brought the book.”\n\nCaro looks down. The terrace lights have begun their slow dimming cycle, surrendering to the dawn. A faint rose creeps across the sky, tinting the glass towers, gilding the frost on the railing. Somewhere behind them, a monitor beeps once, steady and reassuring. The infant is breathing on her own now. The news traveled the corridor like a whisper, soft as snowfall.\n\nIsa uncaps the pen. The click is decisive, final. She places the pen in Caro’s hand, curling her sister’s fingers around it. Their knuckles brush—skin chilled, nails bitten short. Caro’s thumb finds the dent in the barrel where Isa used to chew when she was thinking.\n\n“I can’t draw what I can’t see,” Caro murmurs.\n\n“Then draw what you feel,” Isa says. “I’ll follow.”\n\nCaro presses the tip to the page. The ink spreads, a thin line emerging from the pressure of her hesitation. It wavers, then steadies. She doesn’t draw a shape—only motion, the memory of motion: the arc of a door flung open, the curve of a flight path over Siberia, the slant of rain on the night their mother died. She draws without lifting the pen, the line looping, crossing, searching.\n\nIsa watches. Her left hand hovers, waiting. When the line falters, she covers Caro’s hand with her own. Together they guide the pen forward. The shared line thickens, then thins again, a pulse written in ink. The page warms under their touch.\n\nBelow, a bus exhales steam. A cyclist pedals past, tires crunching salt. The sun breaches the eastern ridge, pouring pale honey across the terrace. It catches the top of the sketchbook, illuminates the sisters’ joined hands.\n\nIsa speaks first, barely louder than the wind. “I thought if I saved enough children, one of them might be mine.”\n\nCaro’s line dips, then rises. “I thought if I never finished the painting, you could still walk back into it.”\n\nThe pen slows. The line settles into a horizon: not the one that divided them, but the one they are now drawing together. They stop when the ink meets the edge of the page, an unbroken seam.\n\nCaro lifts the pen. A small bead of black clings to the paper like a seed. She caps the pen, hands it back. Isa tucks it behind her ear, the cracked cap glinting.\n\nThe rooftop lights click off completely. The city awakens in earnest—horns, gulls, the faraway whine of a train. Yet up here the quiet feels intentional, held.\n\nCaro tears the page free with a soft rip. She folds it once, twice, until it is the size of a matchbook. She presses it into Isa’s palm. “For the next one,” she says.\n\nIsa closes her fist around the paper. “For ours,” she answers.\n\nThey turn toward the door. The yellow latitude line passes under their feet again—unremarked, but walked together. Behind them, the sketchbook remains open on the parapet, the next page blank, waiting.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":690,"completion_tokens":1086,"total_tokens":1776,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
