Caro accuses Isa of ignoring their heritage, while Isa defends her choice to flee conscription, escalating tensions as Luna’s scrambled voice issues the next coordinates.\n\nThe Mercedes Sprinter shuddered over a pothole, sending coffee sloshing against the travel-cup lid. Outside, the A6 sliced through vineyards glazed silver by the floodlights of passing trucks. Inside, the air felt thinner, like someone had cracked a window to November and left the grief inside to sour.  \n\nJi-eun sat sideways on the wheel-well, laptop balanced on her knees, the flash drive pinched between latex-gloved fingers. Klaus drove one-handed, the other resting on a matte-black thigh holster he hadn’t bothered to hide since Mannheim. In the back, Caro and Isa knelt on opposite sides of a mil-spec crate, its lid open to reveal a folded tarp, nylon cuffs, and—now—the slim silver drive spinning mercilessly in the USB hub.\n\nIsa’s breath fogged the cold glass of the sliding door. She watched the Neckar’s black ribbon appear and vanish between stands of frost-bitten poplars. Each mile felt like a seam ripping open inside her chest.\n\nJi-eun tapped a key. The screen blinked from encrypted static to pale institutional gray. A Red Cross emblem, 1996 vintage, jittered into focus.\n\n“Fragment found,” Ji-eun said, voice almost apologetic. “Audio only. Ninety-three seconds.”\n\nThe van speakers crackled, then a woman’s calm European French:  \n“—the compound at Sajik-dong, 3 July 1950. Approximately 2100 hours. Mothers instructed to sing to prevent the children from crying—”  \n\nA lullaby started underneath, soft, unmistakably Korean: the same melody their mother had hummed when fever kept Isa awake, the same Caro later mocked as “cheap sedation.” On the tape it warbled, overexposed, like wind through cracked church glass.\n\n“—before the soldiers opened fire. Only two girls survived, hidden beneath the bodies. One was listed as Kim Eun-hee, age seven. The other’s name is redacted in this copy.”  \n\nThe recording cut to static. Isa felt the sound in her teeth.\n\nCaro’s fist closed around the tarp edge until the fabric bunched like pleated skin. “She never told us.”\n\n“She told us plenty,” Isa said, too quickly.\n\n“She told bedtime stories. Not mass graves.” Caro’s voice scraped raw. She reached toward the keyboard; Ji-eun angled the screen away, protective. “You never wanted the real stories. You called han ‘self-indulgent grief,’ remember? Signed your medical exemption, flew to Berlin, and left the rest of us to carry it.”\n\nThe accusation hung over the drone of tires.\n\nIsa swallowed. The coffee tasted like rust. “They would’ve sent me to the DMZ to stitch up kids who stepped on mines. I couldn’t do it. I chose life—”\n\n“You chose absence,” Caro snapped. “While my brother—” She broke off, pressing knuckles to her mouth. The name didn’t need saying; it lived between them like a third sibling who refused to leave the room.\n\nKlaus’s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, gauging threat levels. Ji-eun paused the playback, leaving the screen frozen on the Red Cross timestamp: 03-07-1950. The date glowed green, accusing.\n\nIsa’s phone buzzed on the crate—unknown number, voice-scramble icon already spinning. She put it on speaker before thinking.  \n\nA wash of digital gravel filled the van. Luna.\n\n“Did you like your mother’s lullaby in surround sound?” The voice modulated up, childlike, then plunged baritone. “Next verse awaits. Coordinates: 49.4875° N, 8.4669° E—”\n\n“That’s where we just came from,” Klaus growled.\n\n“Recalculating,” Luna cooed. “Apologies. New drop: 48.7758° N, 9.1829° E. Stuttgart-Münster. Midnight. Bring your passports; borders are thinning.”  \n\nThe line clicked dead. Silence stretched, elastic and sour.\n\nCaro’s reflection stared at Isa from the dark window: twin pairs of exhausted eyes, fifteen years of distance compressed into one vibrating moment. She spoke first, softer now. “That redacted name. It’s her, isn’t it? Our mother.”\n\nIsa’s throat closed. She managed a nod.\n\nOutside, a road sign flashed: STUTTGART 47 km. The van’s speed crept up, tires humming a low lullaby of their own.\n\nJi-eun quietly closed the laptop. Klaus flicked on the high beams, cutting tunnels through the night. In the sudden cone of light, the next stretch of autobahn looked like an unhealed scar, and they were all just passengers on its back, heading east, always east, chasing the fragments of a song no one wanted to finish.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":693,"completion_tokens":1106,"total_tokens":1799,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
