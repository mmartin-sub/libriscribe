Caro adjusted the final stem in the crystal bowl, her reflection fractured by the water’s surface. At exactly 14:36, Gangnam’s afternoon light slanted through the penthouse’s floor-to-ceiling windows, warming the marble beneath her bare feet. She hummed the Korean lullaby Min used to request when thunderstorms rattled the hanok’s old windows.  \n\n*Jajangga, again, eomma. One more time.*  \n\nShe set the silver watering can on the kitchen island, the metal ringing like a bell. Her phone sat beside it, face-down, on Do Not Disturb. She never took calls between two and three—the hour belonged to her plants, to the silence she’d paid for with fourteen years of eighteen-hour days and a divorce decree stamped in three languages.  \n\nThe elevator chimed softly, but she didn’t turn. The housekeeper knew not to interrupt the orchid hour.  \n\nThen her phone buzzed. Not a call—an encrypted video file, sender unknown. Caro’s thumbnail hovered. She hadn’t opened an unmarked attachment since Damascus, since the day the café exploded and she’d crawled out with someone else’s blood in her mouth.  \n\nBut the timestamp on the file was 14:37:00. Exactly.  \n\nShe pressed play.  \n\nThe screen filled with darkness, then a sliver of light—a freight container’s door cracked open. Two figures knelt inside, bound at wrists and ankles. The first had Luna’s profile, the same stubborn tilt of chin she’d inherited from their mother. The second was smaller, thinner. Min. His Spider-Man T-shirt was twisted, riding up to expose a ribcage that fluttered like a trapped moth. Both were blindfolded. Both had straws taped to their mouths, the plastic quivering with each breath.  \n\nA distorted voice, genderless, scraped out the first line of their childhood lullaby. French first, then Korean, the languages braided like rope.  \n\n“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러.”  \n\nThe video froze. A single line of text replaced it: *Return to the river. Dig where the truth bleeds.*  \n\nThe watering can slipped. It hit the marble and rolled, clanging, water spreading like mercury. Caro’s knees buckled. She caught herself on the island’s edge, orchid petals scattering—bruised dawn turned to bruised everything.  \n\n“Min,” she whispered, the name cracking in her throat.  \n\nShe dialed Luna. Straight to voicemail. She tried Min’s school—busy signal. Her hands shook so violently the phone slipped, skittering across the floor. She crawled after it, silk blouse soaking up water and crushed petals.  \n\nThe penthouse’s intercom shrieked. Mrs. Park the housekeeper, voice tinny with panic. “Ma’am—there are men. In masks. They say—”  \n\nA click. Silence.  \n\nCaro’s reflection stared back from the floor’s mirrored surface: hair disheveled, mascara bleeding, orchid petals stuck to her cheek like shrapnel. The woman who’d once negotiated hostage releases with a calm voice and a spreadsheet was gone.  \n\nShe pressed her forehead to the cold marble.  \n\nFour thousand miles away, Isa was crawling from a burning helicopter. They didn’t know that yet. They only knew the distance between them had never been kilometers or years. It was the secret they’d buried at the river, the one that grew teeth in the dark.  \n\nCaro dragged herself upright. Her reflection wavered, then hardened.  \n\nShe reached for her keys.  \n\nThe elevator doors opened onto the hallway’s sterile light. She stepped inside, orchid petals stuck to her shoes like accusations.  \n\n*Return to the river.*  \n\nThe doors closed.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":558,"completion_tokens":877,"total_tokens":1435,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
