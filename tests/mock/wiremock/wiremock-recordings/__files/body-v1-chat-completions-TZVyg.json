Each woman carries the accumulated weight of fifteen years of silence, regret, and unspoken betrayal. Their parallel journeys—Isa on the Trans-Siberian and Caro on ferries and budget flights—force them to confront the men they left behind, the art they abandoned, and the moment their shared story cracked. When they finally meet in a glass-walled waiting room, the question is no longer who was right or wrong, but whether the flickering life inside an incubator will survive long enough for the first honest sentence in fifteen years to matter.\n\nTold in shifting perspectives—Isa, Caro, their husbands, and the grown children—the novel braids past and present, Ohio and East Asia, painting and medicine, until the latitude at which forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes a choice is reached in the fluorescent hush of a Seoul hospital at 3:00 a.m.\n\n# Chapter List\n3 chapters\n\n# Chapter Details\n\n## Chapter 1: The Call\n### Summary\nAt 4:12 a.m. in her Seoul apartment, Caro answers a call from Samsung Medical Center informing her that Harper—her niece, her sister’s daughter, the child she once painted as a strawberry-stained toddler—has gone into sudden labor at thirty-three weeks. The doctors need next-of-kin consent for an emergency C-section. Isa is unreachable, somewhere on a train between Berlin and the Russian frontier because she still refuses to board a plane. Caro, barefoot in her kitchen, promises to come, then realizes she has no idea how to tell Isa that Harper is even in Korea. The chapter alternates between Caro’s frantic preparations—grabbing her long-abandoned sketchbook as if it were a passport—and flashbacks to the night fifteen years earlier when Isa accepted the Strasbourg fellowship, the night their communal life in Ohio splintered. In the final pages, Caro boards the overnight ferry to Fukuoka, carrying nothing but the sketchbook, a prepaid phone, and the certainty that every rupture is her fault.\n\n### Key Events\n- Caro receives the 4:12 a.m. call from Samsung Medical Center about Harper’s premature labor.\n- Flashback to the night Isa left for Strasbourg and Caro stayed behind.\n- Caro boards the Beetle ferry to Fukuoka to intercept Harper’s professor, the only person who still remembers her art.\n\n## Chapter 2: The Train\n### Summary\nIsa wakes in the swaying berth of the Berlin-Moscow express to a voicemail from a Seoul number she does not recognize. The message is garbled—something about Harper, something about bleeding. She spends the next six hours in the dining car, writing letters to Caro she will probably never send, each one beginning with “I should have told you sooner.” The chapter toggles between Isa’s present-tense panic—bribing a conductor for Wi-Fi, learning Harper is in Seoul, realizing Caro is already on the move—and the past: the Ohio farmhouse where she and Caro raised their children on apples and thrift-store dresses, the night Caro’s husband found the unsent acceptance letter to the Strasbourg fellowship hidden in Isa’s sketchbook. Somewhere past the Urals, Isa decides to fly the final leg from Vladivostok to Incheon, breaking her own rule against giving up too fast. She carries an envelope of fifteen years of unsent letters, now heavier than any suitcase.\n\n### Key Events\n- Isa receives the garbled voicemail about Harper and begins writing unsent letters to Caro.\n- Flashback to the night Caro’s husband discovered Isa’s hidden Strasbourg fellowship acceptance.\n- Isa decides to fly from Vladivostok to Incheon, breaking her no-planes vow.\n\n## Chapter 3: The Latitude\n### Summary\nThe sisters meet at 2:47 a.m. in the NICU waiting room, separated by a wall of glass and the soft beeping of monitors. Caro arrives first, clutching the sketchbook she has not opened in fifteen years; Isa arrives barefoot, her shoes lost somewhere between Siberia and immigration. Over the next eight hours—while the infant’s lungs struggle and Harper sleeps off anesthesia—they speak in fragments, then paragraphs, then the full, unbearable truth: the fellowship, the unsent letters, the painting Caro abandoned, the babies Isa saved but could not carry. Their husbands arrive—Isa’s gentle Frenchman with espresso and apologies, Caro’s Korean-American spouse with divorce papers folded small—and the children, now grown, watch from the hallway. At 5:03 a.m., the baby stabilizes. Isa and Caro step outside into the first pale light of Seoul’s winter dawn, stand at the exact latitude where forgiveness stops being an idea and becomes the choice to speak the next sentence. The book ends with Caro opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Isa handing her a pen, and the two of them beginning—at last—to draw the same line.\n\n### Key Events\n- Isa and Caro reunite in the NICU waiting room at 2:47 a.m.\n- Confession and confrontation: the full truth of the fifteen-year rupture is spoken.\n- The baby stabilizes at 5:03 a.m.; the sisters step outside into dawn.\n- Caro opens her sketchbook; Isa gives her a pen; they begin to draw together.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":820,"completion_tokens":1152,"total_tokens":1972,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
