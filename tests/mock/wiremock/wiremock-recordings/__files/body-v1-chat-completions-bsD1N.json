Luna discovers the laptop displaying the final clue and ABANDON/UPLOAD buttons.\n\nCold metal presses against Luna’s cheek, smelling of diesel and old blood. She blinks, the dim light inside the container rippling like dirty water. Her wrists are taped together in front of her; Min lies a foot away, knees curled to his chest, mouth working against silver duct tape. The air tastes of rust and fear.\n\nA low beep—steady, patient—draws her eyes down. A square of yellow plastic glows between them, bolted to the floor. Seven red digits crawl downward: 09:43…09:42…\n\nLuna’s stomach caves in. She scoots sideways, shoulder scraping corrugated iron, until the tape on her wrists rasps across Min’s ankle. He wakes with a muffled cry. She jerks her chin at the device. Min follows the motion, pupils blowing wide.\n\nThe bomb is nothing like movies. No bright wires or dramatic colors—just a slab of gray explosive the size of a hardcover book encased in clear epoxy. Beneath it, a wafer-thin pressure plate. A green LED blinks every time one of them breathes too deeply.\n\nLuna wiggles until she’s sitting. The motion makes the counter jump—09:35. Min whimpers. She presses her bound hands to her lips, then points to the far end of the container. A laptop sits open on an upended crate, screen angled toward them like a confession booth.\n\nThey crab-walk sideways, knees skimming the trembling plate. Every shift of weight draws another beep, faster now, as if the bomb has a heartbeat. Sweat stings Luna’s eyes; cold air licks the back of her neck. At the crate, she rocks back on her heels and peers at the screen.\n\nCentered on black background, white letters spell the final line of the lullaby their mothers hummed on different continents:\n\n피는 물보다 진하다, mais l’eau efface tout  \n(Blood is thicker than water, but water washes everything away)\n\nBeneath it: two rectangles, side by side.  \nUPLOAD  |  ABANDON\n\nA thin progress bar hovers at 99%. One touch, one choice.\n\nMin makes a strangled sound. Luna looks over. Tears streak the tape over his mouth; his nose bubbles. She lifts her bound wrists, brushes her knuckles across his cheek. The pressure plate chirps again—08:57.\n\nThe container groans as wind slams the outer walls. Somewhere outside, a radio chatters in Korean, voice distorted by static. Luna imagines the river beyond the walls, black water sliding beneath ice, ready to swallow them or spare them.\n\nMin nods toward the laptop, then to their taped wrists. Luna turns back. A slim ridge on the crate’s edge catches the tape; she saws the silver strip against it, sawing, sawing, until the fibers part. Blood prickles back into her fingers. She peels the tape from Min’s mouth first; he gasps, “Luna—”\n\n“Shh.” She presses a finger to his lips, then to the glowing countdown. 08:11.\n\nMin stares at the screen. “That’s… that’s Mom’s report?” His voice cracks on “Mom.”\n\nLuna nods. “If it uploads, it saves everyone they couldn’t save in 1996. But—” She glances at the pressure plate. “Maybe the bomb is rigged to the upload. Or maybe it’s wired to the ABANDON button. We don’t know which is mercy.”\n\nMin’s fingers shake as he reaches toward the trackpad, then pulls back. “What if we do nothing?”\n\nThe counter answers: 07:52.\n\nLuna swallows. The lullaby line loops in her head—blood thicker than water, water washing everything away. She remembers her mother singing it in Spanish, Caro translating the French part against her hair. She remembers Min’s grandmother humming the same tune while ladling kimchi stew. One song, two rivers, one lie.\n\nShe leans closer. Beneath the progress bar, tiny text scrolls: Upload will complete automatically at 00:00 unless ABANDON is selected. Manual override required. She reads it aloud.\n\nMin’s face crumples. “So if we let the timer run, it uploads and maybe blows us up. If we hit ABANDON, it might disarm the bomb but bury the report forever.” He wipes his nose on his sleeve. “We’re the lever.”\n\nLuna’s heart thrums against her ribs. She thinks of Isa’s face above her in the hospital after the Lagos bombing, gentle hands stitching shrapnel cuts, whispering, Some choices cost more than we can carry. She thinks of Caro’s voice on the sat-phone, telling Luna bedtime stories while convoy headlights swept the desert night. Two mothers, one secret.\n\n06:33.\n\nA metallic scrape outside—the container doors? Footsteps circle, slow, deliberate. Whoever left them here is listening.\n\nMin touches the screen; the cursor trembles over UPLOAD. “If we die, the world still learns the truth.” His voice is steadier than his hand. “If we live and the report dies, the truth dies with us.”\n\nLuna covers his hand with hers. “We’re not bargaining chips,” she whispers, echoing the words she heard through the wall minutes ago or a lifetime ago. “We choose for ourselves.”\n\n05:59.\n\nThe LED on the pressure plate flares, as if it hears them. Min breathes in, out. “Together?”\n\nShe nods. Their fingers hover over the trackpad.\n\nOutside, the wind howls louder, rattling the antennae like dead trees clacking bones. The river keeps moving under the ice, patient, ancient.\n\nLuna closes her eyes. She pictures their mothers on opposite banks, waiting.\n\nShe counts the beeps—three, two, one—\n\n—and the container doors burst open, gray light flooding in.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":657,"completion_tokens":1312,"total_tokens":1969,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
