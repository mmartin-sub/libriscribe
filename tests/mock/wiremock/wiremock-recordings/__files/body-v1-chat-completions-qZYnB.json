Caro tightens her grip on the sketchbook—leather cracked like old ice—and looks up expecting a nurse. Instead, a woman crosses the threshold barefoot, sock sagging around one ankle like a loose tourniquet.  \n\nIt is Isa.  \n\nFifteen years have thinned her cheeks to knife edges and darkened the hollows beneath her eyes, but the tilt of her head—that slight, stubborn cant—belongs to the girl who once painted galaxies on the underside of bunk-bed slats. Her coat is buttoned wrong, the hem crusted with something that might be Siberian mud or dried formula. One sleeve is torn at the elbow; a filament of train-station stuffing flutters each time she breathes.  \n\nThe room tilts.  \n\nCaro feels the sketchbook’s metal spiral press crescents into her palm. A vending machine hums. A baby monitor chirps somewhere behind the glass wall, steady as a pulse.  \n\nIsa’s gaze finds Caro’s across the flicker of fluorescent lights. Recognition slams between them—electric, involuntary. Caro’s lungs stall; Isa’s shoulders fold inward, as though the weight of eye contact is more than jet lag and altitude.  \n\nIsa’s lips part. Nothing comes out.  \n\nShe takes one step, then another. The linoleum is the color of weak tea; every footfall smacks damply, heel, arch, toe, until she stands at the midpoint of the room, equidistant from two plastic chairs that have never felt farther apart.  \n\nHer bare foot leaves a faint, wet outline—half moon, dotted toe prints. Caro catches the scent of airline coffee and hospital soap, of metal rails and recycled cabin air, and beneath it all something coppery and intimate: the smell of fear.  \n\nIsa lifts a hand as if to wave, changes her mind, lets it fall. The missing sock exposes a pale ankle tattoo—three tiny black birds in flight, so small they could be freckles. Caro knows each wingtip by heart; she drew them in ballpoint on Isa’s skin the night before her sister boarded the Trans-Siberian the first time.  \n\n“You’re here,” Isa whispers. Her voice rasps, unused for too many days, too many time zones.  \n\nCaro’s reply is a single nod. She wants to stand but her knees feel stapled to the seat. Instead, she slides the sketchbook to the empty chair beside her. The cover bears a smear of graphite—her thumbprint ghosted over years of hesitation.  \n\nIsa’s eyes track the movement. Something flickers across her face: longing, accusation, regret. All three.  \n\n“I dropped my shoes at immigration,” she says, as if that is the only possible explanation for standing shoeless in a Seoul hospital at 3:17 a.m. “They made me take them off. Then the line moved, and—” She shrugs; the coat slips off one shoulder. “They were gone when I looked back.”  \n\nHer voice cracks on gone.  \n\nCaro notices the fine tremble in Isa’s fingers—the same tremor that used to appear whenever their mother raised her voice. She watches Isa’s throat work, watches her swallow whatever else she almost said.  \n\nAcross the glass partition, a nurse adjusts a monitor. The beeping quickens, steadies again. The sound seems to tether them both, a thin wire of shared heartbeat neither wants to break.  \n\nIsa takes the final step. The floor is cold; she curls her toes but doesn’t flinch. She lowers herself into the chair beside the sketchbook, leaving the width of its spine between them—a margin neither invites the other to cross.  \n\nFor a moment they sit in the hush of machines, two women breathing the same recycled air, exhaling different continents. Caro’s pulse drums in her ears; Isa’s bare foot taps once, twice, then stills.  \n\nThe overhead lights buzz. A janitor’s cart squeaks past the open doorway, disappears.  \n\nIsa leans forward, elbows on knees, and stares at her own filthy footprints. “I thought I’d be too late,” she says to the floor. “The train, the flight, the taxi—they all felt like one long delay.”  \n\nCaro’s voice surfaces, hoarse. “You’re here now.”  \n\nIsa lifts her head. Tears glint, unshed. “I didn’t come for Harper,” she says. “I came for you.”  \n\nThe words hang, luminous, between them. Caro feels them settle on her skin like snowflakes that refuse to melt.  \n\nShe reaches out—slow, deliberate—and turns the sketchbook so the fresh, unmarked page faces Isa. The paper is so white it hurts to look at.  \n\nIsa stares at it as though it’s a doorway she’s terrified to cross. Her hand hovers, then drops back to her lap.  \n\nSomewhere behind the glass, a ventilator sighs.  \n\nIsa wipes her eyes with the heel of her hand, smearing exhaustion across her cheek. “We have hours,” she says. “The nurse told me—five or six, maybe more, before they know anything.”  \n\nCaro nods. She realizes her own breathing has synced with the monitors, the same rhythm she once timed her brushstrokes to when Isa modeled for her art-school portfolio.  \n\nIsa’s shoulders rise and fall. She looks down at her bare feet again, then at Caro’s neatly tied sneakers. A faint, incredulous sound—half laugh, half sob—escapes her. “I lost my damn shoes,” she repeats, softer this time.  \n\nCaro finally finds her voice. “I still have your left one,” she says. “The red Converse. It’s in my closet.”  \n\nIsa’s head snaps up. The fluorescent light catches the planes of her face, sharpening every sleepless hour. “You kept it.” Not a question.  \n\nCaro nods once more.  \n\nIsa exhales, a shudder that seems to start in her heels and roll upward. She leans back, the plastic chair creaking like old bones. Their knees almost touch; neither moves away.  \n\nOutside, a gurney rattles past. Inside, the seconds elongate, elastic.  \n\nIsa closes her eyes. When she opens them, they are fixed on the sketchbook. “I dreamed about this page,” she says. “All the way across Russia. I kept seeing it blank, and I kept thinking—what if we never—” She stops, presses her lips together.  \n\nCaro turns the pen she’s been clutching—cheap ballpoint, hospital logo—and offers it.  \n\nIsa doesn’t take it yet. Instead, she reaches across the sketchbook, palm up. The gesture is small, trembling, but unmistakable.  \n\nCaro hesitates. Then, slowly, she places her own hand in her sister’s. Skin to skin for the first time in fifteen years.  \n\nThe touch is ice and fire at once. Caro feels every mile between Moscow and Seoul, every unsent letter, every heartbeat missed.  \n\nIsa’s fingers tighten. “I have something to tell you,” she says. “About the babies. About why I never—”  \n\nThe monitor behind the glass gives a soft, approving chime, as if the room itself is urging them on.  \n\nCaro squeezes back. “Start with the shoes,” she says. “We have time.”  \n\nIsa breathes in, out, steadying herself. She opens her mouth.  \n\nThe floor is still cold beneath her bare foot, but neither of them notices anymore.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":649,"completion_tokens":1671,"total_tokens":2320,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
