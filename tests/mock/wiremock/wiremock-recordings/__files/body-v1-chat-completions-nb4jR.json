A decade later, a single voicemail shatters the distance: Caro’s teenage daughter has vanished, and police have no leads. Isa’s own son has fallen critically ill, chaining her to a French ICU, yet the sisters’ shared childhood promise—“We’ll always come for each other”—echoes louder than passports or pandemic restrictions. Over eighty urgent pages we follow Isa as she steals nights to decode airline rules, bribes embassies with medical favors, and rides cargo trains through a locked-down Europe, while Caro walks Seoul’s neon riverbanks retracing her daughter’s last steps. Each mile peels back the guilt, envy, and love that have kept them apart. Their children—two boys trading video-game codes across time zones, two girls bound by a secret pen-pal pact—become unlikely guides, stitching the continents together with text messages, origami cranes, and a plan wild enough to reunite the sisters on a misty bridge at sunrise. Their journey proves that family isn’t a place on the map; it’s the path you keep walking home.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":332,"total_tokens":522,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
