With strong blurbs and a TikTok hook around sister estrangement, a 35–50k print run is realistic, breakout potential if Reese or Jenna picks it up.  \n- International rights: European and Korean co-editions are plausible given settings; film/TV scouts already hunting cross-cultural family dramas.\n\nOriginality  \nThe core beats—estranged siblings, illness deadline, dual journeys—are familiar. What freshens the concept is the inverse migration (rural Ohio ➜ global cities), the neonatal nurse vs. trailing-spouse dynamic, and the decision to stage the climax in a Seoul NICU rather than the expected Ohio farmhouse. Using a Trans-Siberian train as a moving confessional is less common in contemporary women’s fiction and gives the book a travel-memoir texture.\n\nClarity and Coherence  \nThe logline is crisp, but the description introduces timeline confusion: does the grandchild arrive before or after the sisters meet? Clarify that the labor is imminent but not yet happened. Geography needs tightening: specify that Isa rides the train only as far as Moscow, then flies to Seoul, while Caro ferries to Fukuoka and flies back—keep wonder without violating physics. Finally, define what “forgiveness impossible” means—are we talking permanent estrangement or death of infant? Sharpen stakes to remove melodrama and heighten realism.\n\nSuggested Tweaks  \n1. Replace “trans-Siberian train” with “overnight to Berlin, then the Trans-Siberian to Moscow before a last-seat flight” to ground the logistics.  \n2. Elevate the husbands from props to foils—let one encourage reconciliation, the other sabotage it.  \n3. Seed early flashbacks showing the Ohio sister commune life; this anchors the reader in what was lost.  \n4. Reframe title around rebirth imagery: “The Latitude of Forgiveness” or “Half a World Between Us” for clarity.\n\nBottom line: The concept has breakout potential if the author tackles the travel realism, deepens Korean cultural texture, and keeps the emotional stakes intimate rather than operatic.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":418,"completion_tokens":820,"total_tokens":1238,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
