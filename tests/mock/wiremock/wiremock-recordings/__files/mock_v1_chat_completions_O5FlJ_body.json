Min grips the overhead rail, sneakers dangling inches above briefcases and designer boots. The smell of kimchi jjigae from someone’s lunchbox mixes with perfume and sweat. A phone rings with the same BTS ringtone as yesterday, and Min mouths the lyrics, counting stations until Gangnam—three more stops, then eomma’s orchids.\n\nA man in a navy suit staggers against him. The apology dies on Min’s lips when he sees the surgical mask, white against stubble, and eyes that look past him like he’s already gone. Another mask appears behind. White cotton, elastic straps, no words. Between heartbeats they close in.\n\nMin’s knuckles whiten on the rail. “Ajussi—”\n\nThe train lurches. Doors hiss. The first man’s hand clamps over Min’s mouth, tasting of latex and iron. The second slides an arm under his ribs, lifting. Min kicks; his sneaker strikes a metal pole with a hollow gong that nobody hears over the rush-hour roar. The masks move with choreographed calm, parting the crowd the way Moses split the sea. Passengers look down at phones, up at ads—anywhere but at the boy whose mouth is working soundlessly behind sterile fabric.\n\nThe doors start to close. Min’s fingers scrabble, catch the rubber edge. One fingernail peels back, hot and wet. A woman in a green hanbok finally glances up. Their eyes lock. Help me, Min screams without sound. Her gaze slides away.\n\nThey step off at Seolleung, masks bobbing like mushrooms. Min’s last glimpse of the train is his own reflection in the window, mouth stretched wide beneath the stranger’s palm, while inside the car a child keeps humming the BTS chorus he’ll never finish.\n\n*\n\nThree hundred feet above the Black Forest, the Eurocopter’s rotors beat the winter air into cold cream. Inside the cabin, Isa presses two fingers to the pregnant girl’s carotid—thready but there. Sweat mats the girl’s dark hair to the olive-drab stretcher; her belly rises like a hill under the thermal blanket. The medic beside her adjusts the IV drip with gloved hands. Out the window, fir trees scroll past in dark ranks.\n\n“Five minutes to Ramstein,” Klaus calls through the headset, voice tinny over the turbines. The pilot’s blond stubble catches the console’s green glow. “Weather’s holding.”\n\nIsa nods, though every muscle is braced for turbulence. She’s flown this route four times this month—Mosul to Ramstein, shrapnel to incubators. Routine, they call it, as if any flight carrying a fifteen-year-old mother and her unborn child can be routine.\n\nThe missile hits without sound. Just a white streak, a cough of smoke from the treeline, and then the world tilts.\n\nThe tail rotor disintegrates in a spray of carbon fiber and sparks. The helicopter whips sideways, centrifugal force flinging the medic into the ceiling. The IV bag bursts, saline glittering like glass in the sudden sunlight as the fuselage rolls. Isa’s seatbelt bites her collarbone; something pops hot and wrong in her shoulder.\n\nKlaus’s hands blur over the cyclic, feet working pedals that no longer answer. The forest rushes up—a mosaic of pine and snow. The girl screams, high and thin, joining the mechanical shriek of dying engines.\n\n“Brace!” Klaus shouts, but the word is already behind them.\n\nMetal screams. Trees explode into splinters. The world folds in on itself, glass and blood and the smell of aviation fuel. Isa’s cheek smashes against the window; through spiderweb cracks she sees a red deer bounding away, untouched, while fire blooms in the rearview mirror of her retina.\n\n*\n\n14:36:57. In Seoul, the surgical masks hustle Min down a stairwell that smells of urine and wet concrete. His reflection stutters across broken tiles—small, dark-haired, drowning in adult arms.\n\n14:36:58. In Germany, the helicopter’s belly skids across a clearing, rotors chewing earth until one snaps and cartwheels into the underbrush like a guillotine.\n\n14:37:00. Both phones buzz with the same silent alert. A notification neither sister has the hands to check.\n\nThe deer vanishes between the trees. The subway doors seal shut. Somewhere in the static between two countries, a lullaby begins to play.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":596,"completion_tokens":1002,"total_tokens":1598,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
