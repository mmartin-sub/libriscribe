The memory crystallizes the moment their sisterhood fractured over unspoken resentment.\n\nA smear of cadmium red clung to the corner of Harper’s baby portrait, the same strawberry stain that had bloomed on the toddler’s chin the day Caro first painted her. Seoul dissolved; the kitchen tiles beneath Caro’s bare feet became the warm, scarred pine of the Columbus studio. Late-autumn light poured through the skylight like clarified honey, catching on the glaze of oil tubes scattered across the communal table and igniting the gold flecks in Isa’s hair.\n\nIsa’s hands trembled around the envelope—thick ivory stock, the kind that bruised easily under fingernails. “They want me in Strasbourg by January,” she said, voice thin as the cheap brushes they’d sworn never to use. “Full stipend, the medieval pigment archive, everything.”\n\nCaro’s paintbrush hovered over the gessoed canvas she’d stretched that morning for the joint exhibition they’d talked about since undergrad. The under-sketch stared back at her: two sisters entwined like yin-yang fish, their profiles mirrored in indigo and vermilion. She set the brush down, wiping cobalt from her thumb onto the already-ruined cuff of her flannel. The studio smelled of turpentine and the orange peel they’d shared at breakfast, sweetness masking something sharper.\n\n“How long?” Caro managed.\n\n“Two years. Maybe three.” Isa’s fingers worried the envelope’s wax seal—an embossed bee, wings spread in flight. “It’s not forever.”\n\nThe floorboards creaked as Caro crossed to the window overlooking High Street. Below, students bundled against the first hard frost hurried past the Vietnamese bakery where she and Isa used to split bánh mì on broke-artist Fridays. In the reflection on the glass, Isa’s face joined hers—same sharp cheekbones, same stubborn chin, but her eyes held the fevered gleam Caro recognized from the night Isa had stayed up mixing powdered lapis into ultramarine until her cuticles bled.\n\nCaro’s reflection looked away first.\n\n“You’ll miss the Winterfair,” she said, fingers splayed against the cold pane. “We promised Harper we’d build her that cardboard castle. She’s already picked out the glitter.”\n\nBehind her, Isa laughed—broken glass sound. “Harper won’t remember. She’s three.”\n\nCaro turned. Paint chips clung to the hem of her jeans like dried skin. “But I will.”\n\nThe silence stretched taut as canvas. Somewhere in the building, a ceramic wheel whirred to life, water and clay slapping together with wet percussion. Isa set the envelope on the table between them, next to the chipped mug they used for brush water, its inside stained Prussian blue from years of rinsing. The fellowship letter slid halfway out—French phrases Caro couldn’t read, numbers with too many zeros.\n\n“I can defer,” Isa whispered. “If you—”\n\n“Don’t.” The word cracked out, sharp as palette knife. Caro’s hands found the edges of the table, knuckles whitening against the wood’s paint-scarred surface. She wouldn’t beg. Wouldn’t clutch at Isa’s sleeves the way their mother had clutched at their father’s shirt the night he loaded his Gibson into a stranger’s pickup and drove west without headlights.\n\nIsa stepped closer. Her sock—one of Caro’s, mismatched navy with tiny stars—had a hole at the toe. “Say something real.”\n\nCaro’s gaze dropped to the envelope. The wax seal had softened under the skylight’s heat, bee wings sagging. She thought of the myth they’d learned in art history: Icarus falling because he flew too close to the sun. Because no one had warned him that beauty could melt.\n\n“You already decided,” Caro said. The words tasted of copper and gesso. “Before you opened that letter, you were halfway gone.”\n\nIsa flinched as if slapped. “That’s not—”\n\n“Don’t lie.” Caro’s voice cracked. “You’ve been talking in your sleep. Strasbourg, Strasbourg. Like a prayer.”\n\nThe wheel upstairs went quiet. In the sudden hush, Caro heard her own heartbeat, frantic as a trapped sparrow. Isa’s shoulders began to shake—small earthquakes that built until her whole body convulsed with silent sobs. Paint-streaked hands covered her face, leaving vermilion streaks across her cheeks like war paint.\n\nCaro stayed rooted. If she crossed the three feet between them, she’d fall apart. She’d press her face to Isa’s collarbone, breathing in the citrus of her shampoo, and say stay, stay, stay until the word lost all meaning. Instead, she picked up the envelope, tracing the bee’s wings with one finger.\n\nThe wax came off on her skin, sticky as guilt.\n\nWhen Isa finally looked up, tears had carved pale channels through the paint on her face. “I’m scared,” she said. “That if I don’t go now, I’ll never leave Ohio. I’ll keep painting the same cornfields, same sky, until I forget why I started.”\n\nCaro’s thumb smeared the wax across her own cheekbone. Outside, a siren wailed toward the hospital where Harper had been born three years earlier, where their mother had died two years before that—cycles of coming and going, always someone left holding the empty spaces.\n\n“I’m scared too,” Caro said, barely audible. “That you’ll forget this place. That you’ll forget me.”\n\nIsa reached across the table, but Caro stepped back. The motion knocked over the brush water, blue liquid spreading like bruised veins across their joint exhibition sketch. The indigo sister’s face dissolved first, running into the vermilion until the yin-yang became a muddy wound.\n\n“I’ll call,” Isa said, voice raw. “Every week. We’ll FaceTime while you paint and I’ll—”\n\nCaro was already turning away, pulling down canvases from the drying rack, shoving tubes of paint into her satchel. Her hands found the sketchbook—its cover soft from use—and flipped to Harper’s portrait. The toddler’s smile beamed up at her, strawberry-stained and luminous.\n\n“Take it,” Isa said quietly. “So you’ll know I’m coming back.”\n\nCaro clutched the sketchbook to her chest. The studio smelled suddenly of turpentine and endings. Through the skylight, the sun had shifted, shadows pooling like spilled ink where Isa stood.\n\n“I’ll leave the key under the mat,” Caro said. “For whoever rents this place next.”\n\nShe walked out without looking back, the sketchbook’s pages fluttering against her ribs like trapped wings. Behind her, Isa’s whisper followed—too soft to distinguish between “sorry” and “goodbye”—but Caro didn’t stop. She couldn’t. Some bridges burned from the inside out, fire eating the core while the surface stayed whole, and you never knew they were gone until you tried to cross.\n\nThe stairwell swallowed her whole, each footfall echoing like a gavel. By the time she reached the street, snow had begun to fall—fat, wet flakes that melted on contact with the salted pavement. She tucked the sketchbook inside her jacket, against her heartbeat.\n\nIn the distance, the Vietnamese bakery’s neon sign flickered: PHO REAL. Caro laughed once, sharp and bitter, before the sound strangled itself in her throat. She started walking. Behind her, the studio window glowed golden, but she didn’t turn around. Couldn’t risk seeing Isa’s silhouette already shrinking against the light.\n\nThe snow quickened, erasing footprints as soon as they formed.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":642,"completion_tokens":1685,"total_tokens":2327,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
