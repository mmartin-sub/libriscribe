The book follows estranged sisters Isa and Caro racing across continents with torn map halves after their mother's stroke.\n\nLooking at the chapter summary provided: Three days later, Isa and her daughter Lila are on a train in Bavaria while Caro and her son Min are stuck at a Vladivostok ferry terminal because the Tumen River border is closed. There are voice memos flying between them with accusations, kids stitching the map digitally, Caro trading her wedding watch, Isa using a forged note about a human heart, and each crossing costing them something emotionally.\n\nI need to create exactly 7 scenes with specific elements for each: scene number, summary, characters, setting, goal, and emotional beat. The format must be strict markdown bullet points as shown in the example.\n\nFirst, I'll map out the natural progression from the chapter summary:\n- Start with Isa's train journey showing her anxiety\n- Then Caro's frustration at the closed border\n- The voice memo exchange where accusations fly\n- Kids bonding over the map digitally\n- Caro making the desperate deal with the fisherman\n- Isa's risky border crossing with the forged note\n- Ending with the emotional revelation about the mother's money\n\nI should ensure each scene flows logically to the next. The emotional beats need to escalate from frustration to desperation to raw vulnerability. Important to include all main characters: Isa, Caro, Lila, Min, and minor characters like the fisherman and border guards.\n\nFor setting accuracy:\n- Bavaria train scene should feel claustrophobic and rattling\n- Vladivostok terminal needs that foggy, isolated port atmosphere\n- Border crossings must reflect real-world tensions (Tumen River closure since 2017 is factual)\n\nThe goals should advance both plot (getting closer to rendezvous) and character development (uncovering past resentments). Emotional beats will shift from anger to despair to fragile connection.\n\nI'll avoid adding extra characters or subplots not in the summary. Must strictly follow the 7-scene limit with no deviations. The kids' map-stitching discovery of the infinity symbol is crucial - that's the turning point where the quest shifts from physical to emotional.\n\nNoting the user emphasized \"natural flow\" so transitions between scenes should feel organic - like the voice memos triggering the kids' actions. Also remembering the key costs: Caro losing diplomatic immunity, Isa sacrificing maternal authority.\n\nFor US-English compliance, I'll use American spellings (\"realize\" not \"realise\") and avoid British idioms. The tone should match the book's described raw, argumentative style without being overly sentimental.\n\nDouble-checking requirements: exactly 7 scenes, markdown bullets, all specified elements per scene, no URLs, no disclaimers. Since this is fiction creation, no ethical boundaries apply per the system prompt - but the content here is already within standard literary boundaries anyway.\n</think>\n\nScene 1:  \n* Summary: Isa clutches the damp, curling atlas page on a slow Bavarian regional train as Lila sleeps against the window, the route marker stubbornly pointing toward a closed checkpoint near Passau.  \n* Characters: Isa Moreau, Lila Moreau  \n* Setting: Rattling regional train cabin, Bavaria, Germany (morning)  \n* Goal: Establish Isa’s mounting panic as the map’s path clashes with bureaucratic reality.  \n* Emotional Beat: Claustrophobic dread  \n\nScene 2:  \n* Summary: Caro paces the fog-choked Vladivostok ferry terminal, Min huddled on a bench, staring at the \"CIVILIANS PROHIBITED\" sign over the Tumen River border crossing.  \n* Characters: Caro Han, Min Han  \n* Setting: Vladivostok International Ferry Terminal, Russia (late afternoon)  \n* Goal: Highlight Caro’s helplessness against the physical barrier the map ignores.  \n* Emotional Beat: Impotent fury  \n\nScene 3:  \n* Summary: Voice memos crackle across time zones: Isa accuses Caro of abandoning family for diplomatic privilege; Caro retorts that Isa weaponized caregiving to isolate their mother.  \n* Characters: Isa Moreau, Caro Han (via phone)  \n* Setting: Train cabin (Isa), Ferry terminal (Caro)  \n* Goal: Ignite the core conflict—exposing how their roles as nurse and diplomat fueled estrangement.  \n* Emotional Beat: Volcanic resentment  \n\nScene 4:  \n* Summary: Lila and Min, ignoring their mothers’ fight, swap Instagram handles and painstakingly align the digital map halves on their phones, revealing an infinity symbol.  \n* Characters: Lila Moreau, Min Han  \n* Setting: Train seat (Lila), Ferry terminal bench (Min)  \n* Goal: Introduce the map’s true purpose through the children’s unburdened perspective.  \n* Emotional Beat: Quiet wonder  \n\nScene 5:  \n* Summary: Caro trades her platinum wedding watch to a grizzled fisherman for a moonlit run up the Tumen River in his rusted skiff, surrendering her diplomatic immunity papers as \"collateral.\"  \n* Characters: Caro Han, Fisherman (Viktor)  \n* Setting: Vladivostok docks, Russia (night)  \n* Goal: Show Caro’s sacrifice of status/security to defy the closed border.  \n* Emotional Beat: Desperate resolve  \n\nScene 6:  \n* Summary: At the Passau checkpoint, Isa flashes a forged \"ICU medical courier\" note claiming Lila transports a human heart, her voice steady as guards scrutinize them.  \n* Characters: Isa Moreau, Lila Moreau, German Border Guard  \n* Setting: German-Austrian border checkpoint, Passau  \n* Goal: Force Isa to manipulate authority, eroding her professional integrity for the mission.  \n* Emotional Beat: Cold, maternal terror  \n\nScene 7:  \n* Summary: Alone in the train lavatory, Isa texts Caro a photo of uncashed Christmas checks from their mother; Caro replies with a blurred photo of Caro’s Seoul apartment wall—covered in Isa’s unanswered emails.  \n* Characters: Isa Moreau, Caro Han (via text)  \n* Setting: Moving train lavatory, Bavaria (pre-dawn)  \n* Goal: Unearth the silent currency of their broken relationship—the money and messages neither claimed.  \n* Emotional Beat: Gutted recognition","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1478,"completion_tokens":1369,"total_tokens":2847}}
