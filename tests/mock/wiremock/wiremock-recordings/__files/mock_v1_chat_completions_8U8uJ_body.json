Caro had arranged them herself at dawn, tweezing each stem into place while Min practiced his hanja at the kitchen counter, tongue poking from the corner of his mouth. Now the tray slips from her fingers as if gravity has doubled, orchids cartwheeling through the air in slow motion.  \n\nPorcelain bursts against marble with a sound like ice breaking over deep water. Potting mix sprays across the floor in dark, wet applause. A shard spins up, kisses her right palm, and keeps spinning. Blood beads, fat as pomegranate seeds, before gravity reasserts itself and they roll down her wrist in hot streaks.  \n\nThe tablet lies three feet away, screen cracked but still alive. Min’s reflection flickers inside it—nine years old, cheeks round with baby fat, blindfold white as surgical gauze. The straw between his lips trembles with every breath.  \n\n“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러,” the voice drones, electronic and sexless, as if the lullaby were being sung by the air itself.  \n\nCaro’s knees hit the floor hard enough to bruise. She doesn’t feel it. Her fingers, slick with blood, crawl toward the screen. They hover over Min’s face, afraid to touch, terrified to discover he’s only two-dimensional.  \n\nThe timestamp burns in the corner: 14:37. She has watched it loop four times now. Each cycle ends with the same instruction: Return to the river where you buried the truth.  \n\nRiver.  \n\nHer mind snags on the word like fabric on barbed wire. There is only one river that ever mattered. The Rhine, slate-gray and fast beneath the Hohenzollern Bridge, its surface chopped into silver scales by the wind. The night she and Isa stood on the pedestrian walkway, seventeen years old, sharing a cigarette they didn’t want and a secret they couldn’t carry. The night they swore never to speak of it again—not to each other, not to anyone.  \n\nCaro’s reflection blurs in the black screen. The woman staring back is flawless until the blood drips off her chin and mars the image. Somewhere below, Seoul honks and blinks, a circuit board of neon and ambition. Up here, the air smells of broken stems and spilled soil, humid, sweet, rotting.  \n\nShe tries to stand. Her legs refuse. Instead she crawls forward, knees grinding into porcelain grit, and drags the tablet closer. The video restarts. Min’s small chest rises, falls. The straw whistles.  \n\n“Mom,” she whispers to the empty penthouse, because there is no one else left to hear. “I’m coming.”  \n\nThe word tastes foreign—Mom—not the elegant eomma she trained Min to use, but the raw, childish desperation she thought she’d outgrown. Blood smears across the screen as she swipes, searching for metadata, GPS, anything. Nothing. Whoever took him knew how to scrub a feed clean.  \n\nOutside, the Han River glints between skyscrapers, a dull ribbon of light. Not the Rhine. Not the right river. But close enough to mock her.  \n\nCaro presses her bleeding palm to the cool marble. The pain grounds her, sharp and bright. She breathes through it, counting heartbeats. One, two, three—  \n\nShe rises. Glass crunches under her Louboutins. The orchids lie in pieces, petals bruised purple at the edges like fingerprints. She steps over them, leaving bloody half-moons on the floor.  \n\nIn the bedroom she yanks a duffel from the closet. Passport, cash, burner phone—she’s never unpacked the go-bag since the last time. The last time she swore she’d never run again.  \n\nThe tablet is still playing when she returns. Min’s shoulders jerk; someone off-screen adjusts the straw. A freight-container echo hollows every breath. Caro pauses the video on his face, captures the still, sends it to an encrypted server in Luxembourg, then wipes the tablet clean with the tail of her silk blouse.  \n\nShe slings the duffel over her shoulder. At the elevator, she hesitates, looks back. The penthouse gleams—white leather, chrome, orchid petals like fallen wings. A life curated to withstand any tremor.  \n\nThe tremor has come from inside.  \n\nAs the doors close, Caro catches her reflection one last time: hair still immaculate, blood drying in elegant streaks down her forearm. She looks like a woman who has already crossed a border and isn’t sure she’ll be allowed back.  \n\nThe elevator descends. Seoul recedes above her, a hive of light. Somewhere over the Pacific, Isa is crawling from a fire she doesn’t yet know is connected. Somewhere in a box on a truck, Min is counting breaths.  \n\nCaro closes her eyes. The lullaby loops in her head, half French, half Korean, wholly theirs. She mouths the next line—the one the voice didn’t speak—and tastes seventeen again, river wind biting her cheeks, Isa’s hand slippery in hers as they dropped the bundle into the current and watched it sink.  \n\nThe elevator dings. Lobby. She steps out, heels steady now. Outside, a black car waits, engine idling. She doesn’t remember calling it, but she climbs in anyway.  \n\n“Airport,” she says. “Lufthansa. First flight to Frankfurt.”  \n\nThe driver nods, pulls into traffic. Seoul blurs into streaks of red and white. Caro opens her hand. The cut is deeper than she thought, a pale canyon across her lifeline. Blood wells, slow and deliberate.  \n\nShe presses it to the window, leaving a small, perfect print. A signature. A promise.  \n\nThe river is waiting.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":603,"completion_tokens":1311,"total_tokens":1914,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
