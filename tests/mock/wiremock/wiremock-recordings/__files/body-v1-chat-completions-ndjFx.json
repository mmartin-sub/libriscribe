She held it anyway, fingers wrapped around the rim as if the ceramic still carried warmth. Across the glass partition, the baby’s incubator glowed under a soft halo of blue light. Tiny chest rising, falling. Rising, falling. A rhythm too fragile to trust.\n\nIsa sat on the floor now, spine against the wall, her bare feet tucked beneath the hem of her coat. The soles were gray with hospital dust. She hadn’t spoken in twenty minutes. Caro hadn’t asked why.\n\nA nurse in lavender scrubs moved past them, clipboard in hand, the rubber soles of her shoes squeaking once against the linoleum—then nothing. The waiting room had grown unnaturally still, the kind of stillness that waits for something to break it.\n\nIt broke at 5:00 a.m. sharp.\n\nA thin, reedy sound cut through the hush—not a cry, not a word, but something raw and animal. Harper’s voice, hoarse from the breathing tube. “Isa...” Just that. A name stretched thin by pain and drugs and the effort of remembering how to speak.\n\nCaro’s head snapped up.\n\nIsa was already on her feet, coat slipping from her shoulders, eyes wide and unseeing. She took one step toward the glass—and the alarm went off.\n\nNot the steady, reassuring beep of before. This was a staccato shriek, red light strobing above the incubator. A sound like metal being torn. The baby’s chest was no longer rising, no longer falling.\n\nTwo nurses burst through the door in a blur of motion. One slapped a mask over her own face; the other reached for something inside the bassinette, movements sharp, precise, too fast to follow.\n\nCaro’s hand moved without thought, finding Isa’s wrist. Isa didn’t pull away. Her skin was ice. Pulse hammering under the thin bones.\n\n“Brady down to sixty,” someone called. “Bag him. Now.”\n\nCaro’s grip tightened. She felt the tremor in her own fingers, the way they wanted to crush, to anchor, to keep something—someone—from slipping away. Isa’s other hand lifted, hovered just above Caro’s. Not quite touching. Not yet.\n\nThey stood like that, shoulder to shoulder, breath fogging the glass. The world narrowed to the space between them and the baby—who was no longer moving, not even a twitch, just the awful stillness of a body too small to fight.\n\nA doctor arrived, hair still damp from a shower, mask already tied. “Suction,” she said. “Epinephrine in the drawer. Let’s go.”\n\nCaro’s throat ached. She hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath. She exhaled through her teeth, a thin, shaky sound. Isa made no sound at all.\n\nThen—movement. A flicker. The baby’s foot kicked once, twice, like a reflex. The monitor squawked, numbers climbing. Brady at seventy. Seventy-five. A nurse adjusted the oxygen flow, murmuring something too low to catch.\n\nCaro felt it first in her knees, the way they wanted to fold. She leaned in, just slightly. Her shoulder brushed Isa’s. Neither of them moved away.\n\nThe alarm stopped.\n\nThe red light dimmed.\n\nThe baby’s chest rose—shallow, but there.\n\nIsa’s hand dropped. Not to her side. Onto Caro’s. Palm to palm, fingers interlaced like they’d done once, long ago, when they were small and the world was still something they could hold together.\n\nNeither of them looked down.\n\nThrough the glass, the doctor stepped back, nodding once to the nurse. The baby’s color shifted from ashen to something closer to alive. A tube snaked from the infant’s mouth, taped in place with surgical precision. The incubator door sealed with a soft click.\n\nThe waiting room exhaled.\n\nCaro felt the sweat on her back, cold now, sticking to her shirt. She didn’t let go. Neither did Isa.\n\nSomewhere down the hall, Harper’s voice came again, softer this time, drifting like smoke. “Is he okay?” Not a plea. A question. The kind that already knows the answer.\n\nIsa didn’t answer her daughter. Not yet. She just stood there, hand in Caro’s, watching the baby breathe.\n\nWatching them breathe.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":660,"completion_tokens":993,"total_tokens":1653,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
