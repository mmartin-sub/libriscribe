When Isa’s husband, an EU humanitarian logistics officer, is transferred to Strasbourg, and Caro follows her Korean diplomat spouse to Seoul, the sisters fall into separate orbits across twelve time zones. Years collapse into quick video calls and missed birthdays until their mother’s stroke cracks open a family secret: a hand-drawn atlas of impossible train lines, midnight ferries, and unmarked bridges said to be ‘passable only by the brave.’ Each sister receives half of the map and a cryptic plea—come together before the last ‘meridian moon’ or lose the family thread forever.\\n\\nWith their own children in tow—Isa’s fearless daughter and Caro’s anxious son—the women launch twin odysseys, trading WhatsApp breadcrumbs as they ride midnight freighters, board bullet trains, and cross contested borders. At every checkpoint they confront the reasons they drifted: career envy, parenting shame, and the silent fear that love can expire. The journey demands they become the mothers—and sisters—they thought they no longer had time to be.\"\n}\n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":190,"completion_tokens":313,"total_tokens":503,"prompt_tokens_details":null}}
