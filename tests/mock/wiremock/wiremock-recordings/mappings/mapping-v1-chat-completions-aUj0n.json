A single video shows the kids bound in a freight container, a seven-day countdown ticking beneath bilingual fragments of that lullaby. To save them, Isa and Caro must trace the 37th parallel east across Europe and Asia, solving cryptic clues that resurrect every buried betrayal between them. With the help of a guilt-ridden German pilot and a K-pop logistics prodigy, they race through the Rhine, Neckar, Danube, and the steppes to Vladivostok, guided by their own daughters hacking the chase from inside the container. At the final coordinate\\u2014a derelict Soviet listening post on the Russian-Korean border\\u2014they face an impossible lever: expose a wartime atrocity that will destroy their reputations and families, or lose the children forever. In the end, the question is not how far they will travel, but how much of themselves they are willing to surrender to the river of secrets that once divided them.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: Dawn breaks iron-gray over the Russian-Korean border. The container sits inside a rusted listening post, antennae like dead trees. Inside, Luna and Min are wired to a pressure-plate bomb; a single laptop displays the final lullaby line\\u2014\\u201c\\ud53c\\ub294 \\ubb3c\\ubcf4\\ub2e4 \\uc9c4\\ud558\\ub2e4, mais l\\u2019eau efface tout\\u201d\\u2014and two buttons: UPLOAD or ABANDON. The upload is the complete 1996 Red Cross report, implicating Isa in suppressing evidence of a civilian massacre to protect MSF neutrality, and naming Caro\\u2019s grandfather as a collaborator with North Korean units. If released, Pyongyang will blacklist every Park descendant; Interpol will revoke Isa\\u2019s medical license. The kidnapper steps from the shadows: their mother\\u2019s former interpreter, left for dead in 1996, now seeking poetic justice. Isa and Caro argue in the snow, voices hoarse, until Luna whispers through the container wall: \\u201cWe\\u2019re not bargaining chips. Do what you couldn\\u2019t do before\\u2014choose us.\\u201d In the end, Caro\\u2019s hand covers Isa\\u2019s on the lever. They press UPLOAD together. The bomb disarms; the doors swing open. The report goes public as they carry the children across the frozen Tumen River. Behind them, the listening post burns, taking the lullaby with it. They walk forward, not as saviors or sinners, but as sisters who finally let the river carry their secrets out to sea.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 7 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 7 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}], \"temperature\": 0.5, \"timeout\": 360.0}",
