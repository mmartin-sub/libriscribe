A single video shows the kids bound in a freight container, a seven-day countdown ticking beneath bilingual fragments of that lullaby. To save them, Isa and Caro must trace the 37th parallel east across Europe and Asia, solving cryptic clues that resurrect every buried betrayal between them. With the help of a guilt-ridden German pilot and a K-pop logistics prodigy, they race through the Rhine, Neckar, Danube, and the steppes to Vladivostok, guided by their own daughters hacking the chase from inside the container. At the final coordinate—a derelict Soviet listening post on the Russian-Korean border—they face an impossible lever: expose a wartime atrocity that will destroy their reputations and families, or lose the children forever. In the end, the question is not how far they will travel, but how much of themselves they are willing to surrender to the river of secrets that once divided them.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: Tuesday begins like any other for both sisters. Isa is mid-air in a Médecins Sans Frontières helicopter evacuating a pregnant teenager from Mosul to Ramstein when a surface-to-air missile clips the tail rotor; the chopper spins into the Black Forest. Simultaneously, in Seoul, Caro’s nine-year-old son Min is pulled off a jam-packed subway by silent men in surgical masks. At 14:37 exactly, both women receive the same encrypted video: Luna and Min bound, blindfolded, and breathing through straws inside a freight container. A distorted voice recites the first line of their childhood lullaby—“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러”—then demands they return to the river where they buried the truth. Isa crawls from the burning wreckage with a dislocated shoulder and a concussion; Caro drops a tray of orchids in a Gangnam penthouse, her perfectly manicured world cracking like porcelain. Both realize the distance they cultivated was never geographic at all.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 6 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 6 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}]}",
