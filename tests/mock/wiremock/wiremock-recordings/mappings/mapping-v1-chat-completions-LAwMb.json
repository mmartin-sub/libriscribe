Do NOT add any introduction, conclusion, or conversational text. Start immediately with the content of Chapter 1.\\nThe book is written in en.\\nChapters:\\n# Chapter 1: The Fracture at 14:37\\n\\nThe orchids were the color of bruised dawn\\u2014phalaenopsis in milky lavender, petals so flawless they looked photoshopped. Caro adjusted the final stem in the crystal bowl, her reflection fractured by the water\\u2019s surface. At exactly 14:36, Gangnam\\u2019s afternoon light slanted through the penthouse\\u2019s floor-to-ceiling windows, warming the marble beneath her bare feet. She hummed the Korean lullaby Min used to request when thunderstorms rattled the hanok\\u2019s old windows.\\n\\n*Jajangga, again, eomma. One more time.*\\n\\nShe set the silver watering can on the kitchen island, the metal ringing like a bell. Her phone sat beside it, face-down, on Do Not Disturb. She never took calls between two and three\\u2014the hour belonged to her plants, to the silence she\\u2019d paid for with fourteen years of eighteen-hour days and a divorce decree stamped in three languages.\\n\\nThe elevator chimed softly, but she didn\\u2019t turn. The housekeeper knew not to interrupt the orchid hour.\\n\\nThen her phone buzzed. Not a call\\u2014an encrypted video file, sender unknown. Caro\\u2019s thumbnail hovered. She hadn\\u2019t opened an unmarked attachment since Damascus, since the day the caf\\u00e9 exploded and she\\u2019d crawled out with someone else\\u2019s blood in her mouth.\\n\\nBut the timestamp on the file was 14:37:00. Exactly.\\n\\nShe pressed play.\\n\\nThe screen filled with darkness, then a sliver of light\\u2014a freight container\\u2019s door cracked open. Two figures knelt inside, bound at wrists and ankles. The first had Luna\\u2019s profile, the same stubborn tilt of chin she\\u2019d inherited from their mother. The second was smaller, thinner. Min. His Spider-Man T-shirt was twisted, riding up to expose a ribcage that fluttered like a trapped moth. Both were blindfolded. Both had straws taped to their mouths, the plastic quivering with each breath.\\n\\nA distorted voice, genderless, scraped out the first line of their childhood lullaby. French first, then Korean, the languages braided like rope.\\n\\n\\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec.\\u201d\\n\\nThe video froze. A single line of text replaced it: *Return to the river. Dig where the truth bleeds.*\\n\\nThe watering can slipped. It hit the marble and rolled, clanging, water spreading like mercury. Caro\\u2019s knees buckled. She caught herself on the island\\u2019s edge, orchid petals scattering\\u2014bruised dawn turned to bruised everything.\\n\\n\\u201cMin,\\u201d she whispered, the name cracking in her throat.\\n\\nShe dialed Luna. Straight to voicemail. She tried Min\\u2019s school\\u2014busy signal. Her hands shook so violently the phone slipped, skittering across the floor. She crawled after it, silk blouse soaking up water and crushed petals.\\n\\nThe penthouse\\u2019s intercom shrieked. Mrs. Park the housekeeper, voice tinny with panic. \\u201cMa\\u2019am\\u2014there are men. In masks. They say\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nA click. Silence.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s reflection stared back from the floor\\u2019s mirrored surface: hair disheveled, mascara bleeding, orchid petals stuck to her cheek like shrapnel. The woman who\\u2019d once negotiated hostage releases with a calm voice and a spreadsheet was gone.\\n\\nShe pressed her forehead to the cold marble.\\n\\nFour thousand miles away, Isa was crawling from a burning helicopter. They didn\\u2019t know that yet. They only knew the distance between them had never been kilometers or years. It was the secret they\\u2019d buried at the river, the one that grew teeth in the dark.\\n\\nCaro dragged herself upright. Her reflection wavered, then hardened.\\n\\nShe reached for her keys.\\n\\nThe elevator doors opened onto the hallway\\u2019s sterile light. She stepped inside, orchid petals stuck to her shoes like accusations.\\n\\n*Return to the river.*\\n\\nThe doors closed.\\n\\nWind claws at the open bay door, sucking the heat from every exposed inch of skin. Isa braces a boot against a red web net and leans into the slipstream, gloved fingers riding the pulse at the teenager\\u2019s ankle. It flutters once\\u2014twice\\u2014then steadies.\\n\\n\\u201cPressure\\u2019s dropping, Doc,\\u201d Jodie shouts over the rotor roar, one hand squeezing the blood-pressure bulb while the other pins the chart to her thigh.\\n\\n\\u201cGive me sixty of ketamine, push,\\u201d Isa answers without looking up. Her voice is the same note she\\u2019s used for every casualty in every war zone for the last seven years: low, flat, impossible to disobey.\\n\\nThe pregnant girl\\u2014fifteen, maybe sixteen\\u2014lies strapped to a NATO litter, knees splayed, a crimson pad blooming beneath her. Sweat beads on her upper lip despite the January cold that turns every breath into frost. Her eyes roll white beneath half-closed lids, the lashes sticky with dust and tears.\\n\\nIsa slides an ultrasound probe across the girl\\u2019s bare belly. The screen is a snowstorm of static, but she catches the flicker of a fetal heart at one-forty. Good. Still fighting.\\n\\n\\u201cContractions every four minutes,\\u201d Erik calls from the head of the litter. He\\u2019s Norwegian, cheeks wind-burned, headset askew. \\u201cBleeding\\u2019s arterial\\u2014look at that spurt.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cClamp it or pack it. Jodie, another liter of O-neg wide open. Erik, prep the rapid infuser.\\u201d\\n\\nHer own pulse feels distant, a metronome keeping time with the rotor thud. She\\u2019s beyond tired; she\\u2019s hollowed out and sanded smooth, the way driftwood gets after too many tides. But the body on the stretcher needs the version of her that never sleeps, so she stays in that narrow band of focus where nothing exists except vitals and verbs.\\n\\nThe Black Forest scrolls beneath them like black-green carpet, fir tops whipping past in stroboscopic flashes of moonlit silver. A patch of snow on a ridgeline glints like broken glass. Somewhere down there are villages and ski lifts and people who have never smelled cordite or birthing blood.\\n\\nThe girl whimpers. Isa bends close enough to taste the copper on the air. \\u201cHey, small warrior. Stay with me.\\u201d Arabic, soft, almost a lullaby. \\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor.\\u201d The phrase slips out before she can stop it\\u2014then she clamps down, switches back to English. \\u201cYou\\u2019re almost safe.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDoc, tail rotor\\u2019s running hot,\\u201d the pilot crackles through the headset. \\u201cTen minutes to Ramstein.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCopy. Ten minutes,\\u201d Isa replies, but her mind is already triaging those six hundred seconds: pack the uterus, splint the pelvis, keep the airway open, keep the baby on the monitor. She\\u2019s done more in less.\\n\\nA vibration she can\\u2019t name ripples through the deck plates, followed by a high metallic whine. Erik\\u2019s head jerks toward the rear. \\u201cWas that\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe helicopter bucks, tail sliding left. The litter skids sideways; the IV line snaps taut. Alarms shriek as the g-forces slam Isa against the bulkhead. For a heartbeat, everything tilts: the girl\\u2019s pale face, the forest spinning below like a roulette wheel, Jodie\\u2019s mouth open in a silent shout.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s last coherent thought before the world fragments is absurdly clinical\\u2014Note to self: check shoulder for dislocation after impact\\u2014then the night rushes in, rotors howling, metal screaming, and the smell of aviation fuel floods the cabin like a promise already broken.\\n\\n## Scene 2: The Black Forest Descent\\n\\nThe missile came from nowhere.\\n\\nA streak of white fire that kissed the tail rotor like a lover\\u2019s betrayal. The impact felt soft at first\\u2014just a shudder through the airframe, a whisper of something wrong. Then the helicopter twisted, metal screaming as the world flipped sideways.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s headset tore off in the spin. The pregnant girl\\u2014Amira, sixteen years old and bleeding through her abaya\\u2014floated against her restraints, mouth open in a silent scream. The pilot\\u2019s hands were frantic on the cyclic stick, trying to coax life from dying hydraulics. Outside the windshield, pine trees spun in a dizzy carousel of green and brown.\\n\\n\\u201cMayday mayday mayday\\u2014\\u201d The copilot\\u2019s voice cut to static as the radio antenna sheared away.\\n\\nThe Black Forest rushed up to meet them. Isa had time to think: *This is where fairy tales come to die.* Then impact\\u2014hard, harder than she\\u2019d imagined death would feel. Metal folding like paper. Fuel igniting in a whoosh of heat that peeled paint from the fuselage.\\n\\nShe came to hanging upside down in her harness.\\n\\nBlood ran into her eyes\\u2014warm, metallic. The world tilted at impossible angles through the cracked windshield. Amira was unconscious but breathing, each exhale fogging a small circle on the cracked plexiglass. Beyond the glass, smoke curled around tree trunks like incense.\\n\\nThe pilot groaned somewhere behind her. \\u201cGet out... fuel line...\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s left shoulder was wrong\\u2014dislocated, maybe worse. She bit down on the scream as she released her harness, dropping to the ceiling with bone-jarring force. The helicopter groaned around her, settling deeper into the pine carpet that had broken their fall.\\n\\n\\u201cAmira.\\u201d She crawled across buckled metal, each movement sending fire through her collarbone. \\u201cAmira, wake up.\\u201d\\n\\nThe girl\\u2019s eyelids fluttered. \\u201cCold,\\u201d she whispered in Arabic. \\u201cSo cold.\\u201d\\n\\nSmoke thickened, black and chemical. Through the broken windshield, Isa could see flames licking up the side of the wreckage, orange tongues tasting the fuel that pooled beneath them. The smell of burning aviation fuel mixed with something worse\\u2014cooked flesh, maybe. Maybe her own.\\n\\nShe got Amira\\u2019s harness unbuckled, cradled the girl\\u2019s head as she lowered her to what had become their floor. The pregnancy was high-risk\\u2014pre-eclampsia, the doctors at the field hospital had said. Now she was bleeding again, dark stains spreading across pale fabric.\\n\\n\\u201cMy baby,\\u201d Amira gasped. \\u201cPlease\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve got you.\\u201d Isa\\u2019s voice sounded foreign, like someone else speaking through her mouth. \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting out.\\u201d\\n\\nThe emergency exit was jammed, warped metal refusing to budge. Isa kicked at it with her good leg, felt the impact travel up through her teeth. On the third kick, it gave way with a shriek of tortured aluminum.\\n\\nFresh air rushed in\\u2014cold, pine-scented, laced with diesel smoke. Behind them, something popped. The fire found the fuel tank.\\n\\nIsa grabbed Amira under the arms and pulled. The girl weighed nothing\\u2014fever and blood loss had hollowed her out. They tumbled through the exit just as the helicopter coughed its first explosion, heat washing over them like a tide.\\n\\nThey rolled down a slope of pine needles and wet earth. The second explosion came when they were twenty feet away, close enough to feel the concussion in their bones but far enough that the shrapnel whistled overhead instead of through them.\\n\\nIsa came to rest against a fallen log, lungs burning with smoke and altitude. Amira lay beside her, eyes closed, one hand resting protectively on her swollen belly. Beyond the burning wreckage, the Black Forest stretched in all directions\\u2014dark, ancient, indifferent.\\n\\nHer phone buzzed.\\n\\nThe sound was wrong here, too modern for a place that had swallowed armies. She fumbled it from her pocket with shaking fingers, the screen cracked but still glowing. The caller ID showed nothing\\u2014just a string of zeros that hurt to look at.\\n\\nShe almost didn\\u2019t answer. Almost threw the phone into the flames that were now consuming what remained of the helicopter. But something in the rhythm of the buzz felt familiar, like a heartbeat she\\u2019d forgotten she had.\\n\\n\\u201cHello?\\u201d\\n\\nThe video began automatically. No buffering, no warning. Just Luna\\u2019s face filling the screen\\u2014her sister\\u2019s daughter, twelve years old and gap-toothed, now bound and blindfolded. A plastic straw protruded from her mouth like a feeding tube. Behind her, another child\\u2014Min, Caro\\u2019s son\\u2014curled into himself, small and terrified.\\n\\nThe voice that followed was not human. It had been processed through so many filters that only cadence remained, the rise and fall of syllables that belonged in their childhood bedroom in Busan.\\n\\n\\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec.\\u201d\\n\\n*Sleep, my treasure, sing the lullaby.*\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s phone slipped from numb fingers. The video kept playing, now showing the inside of what looked like a shipping container. Metal walls. LED strips casting harsh shadows. The children\\u2019s breathing sounded like waves against a shore.\\n\\nThen: \\u201cReturn to the river where you buried the truth. You have forty-eight hours.\\u201d\\n\\nThe screen went black. In the distance, sirens wailed\\u2014German emergency services responding to the smoke column that now rose above the tree line. Somewhere in the wreckage, Amira stirred and moaned.\\n\\nIsa stared at the dying fire and understood two things with crystalline clarity:\\n\\nThe distance she\\u2019d spent seventeen years cultivating hadn\\u2019t just been geographic. It had been a lie she told herself, a story about safety and separation and the price of running from your own history.\\n\\nAnd now the river was calling them home.\\n\\nShe stood, cradling her useless arm against her chest, and began walking toward the sound of approaching sirens. Each step hurt in ways that had nothing to do with dislocated joints or smoke-scorched lungs.\\n\\nBehind her, the Black Forest burned.\\n\\nThe orchids arrived at dawn\\u2014white Phalaenopsis flown in from Jeju, stems wrapped in damp cotton and Korean newsprint. Caro lifts one from the crate with surgical care, the roots still dewy, breathing like gills. She positions it on the mirrored console beside the living-room window, where the Han River glints thirty-three floors below and the morning sun refracts through triple-pane glass. Every angle is measured: one inch left to catch the light, a quarter-turn so the lowest blossom faces the sofa. Her reflection\\u2014black silk blouse, pearl studs, the flawless side-part she\\u2019s worn since university\\u2014multiplies into infinity inside the mirror.\\n\\nAcross the room, Min stomps out choreography on a pale-wood floor that never saw a scuff until he learned to moonwalk. The tablet\\u2019s speakers thump a bass line Caro refuses to recognize; the boy\\u2019s T-shirt swings like a flag. He is all elbows and velocity, nine years of unchecked momentum.\\n\\n\\u201cMin-ah.\\u201d Caro slides the orchid forward, aligning its spine with the brass seam in the mirror\\u2019s frame. \\u201cLine two closes at rush hour. You\\u2019ll ride with Mrs. Choi today.\\u201d\\n\\nMin spins, sneakers squeaking. \\u201cEomma, I\\u2019m not a baby.\\u201d He drags the last vowel into a groan, then drops into a squat, arms crossing over his chest in perfect sync with the dancer onscreen. The motion kicks up a faint smell of grapefruit from the diffuser hidden beneath the sofa.\\n\\nCaro clips a dried aerial root with her shears. Snip. \\u201cThe subway is a crush of strangers and a playground for perverts.\\u201d She keeps her tone level, conversational, the same register she used last week with the board of directors. \\u201cMrs. Choi drives a Mercedes.\\u201d\\n\\nMin\\u2019s bangs flop over his eyes as he pops up, hair still holding yesterday\\u2019s salon glaze. \\u201cAll the kids take the train. Jisung goes alone. Jisung is eight.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJisung\\u2019s mother does not have my enemies.\\u201d\\n\\nThe boy pauses the video. Silence blooms, heavy as the humidity trapped inside the orchid crates. Min looks at her\\u2014really looks\\u2014for the first time all morning. His irises are almost black, like river stones slicked by rain. \\u201cDo you have enemies, Eomma?\\u201d\\n\\nCaro places the shears beside the orchid, aligning their handles parallel to the console\\u2019s edge. \\u201cEveryone with something worth taking has enemies.\\u201d She folds the damp newspaper into a perfect square. \\u201cFinish your stretches. We leave in fifteen.\\u201d\\n\\nMin scowls but obeys, rolling his shoulders, counting under his breath in English\\u2014one and two and three\\u2014accent flawless from Saturday tutors. Caro watches the narrow blades of his shoulder blades beneath the cotton. So small, she thinks, yet already practicing how to vanish into crowds. The thought bruises her somewhere private.\\n\\nThe penthouse smells of orchid sap and imported citrus. Floor-to-ceiling glass turns Seoul into a silent diorama: toy cars on the Teheran-ro, ant-size salarymen scurrying toward glass towers that reflect the sky like polished knives. Here, thirty-three floors up, Caro has engineered a pocket of stillness\\u2014white orchids, white sofa, white noise. She checks her watch: 7:12 a.m. Nine hours and twenty-five minutes until everything fractures.\\n\\nMin grabs his backpack\\u2014limited-edition, black with reflective chevrons\\u2014and jams the tablet inside. The zipper snags on the headphone cord; he yanks once, twice. \\u201cEomma, can we stop at the bakery? I want the croissant with the chocolate inside.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe have croissants in the freezer.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re not the same.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro lifts the tray of orchids. Porcelain clinks against porcelain as she carries them toward the kitchen island, each pot balanced on a linen napkin to prevent water rings. She hears herself sigh, a sound like silk tearing. \\u201cOne chocolate croissant. Then straight to the subway entrance. Mrs. Choi will be waiting.\\u201d\\n\\nMin beams, victory in eight-year-old terms. He skips ahead to the elevator, sneakers flashing like semaphore. Caro follows, heels silent on marble. In the reflective brass doors she sees them side by side: her posture a metronome, his limbs already jittering to the beat inside his head. The distance between their shoulders is exactly three orchid pots wide.\\n\\nThe elevator descends. Thirty-three. Thirty-two. Thirty-one.\\n\\nMin hums the chorus of whatever song has colonized his brain. Caro closes her eyes. For a moment she smells pine needles and river mud, hears a lullaby in two languages braided together like rope. She opens her eyes. The doors ding open onto marble and morning light.\\n\\nOutside, the city waits\\u2014dense, humming, anonymous. Caro tightens her grip on the tray. Porcelain trembles but does not crack.\\n\\nThe Black Forest tasted of pine sap and jet fuel. Isa hung upside-down in her seat harness, blood roaring in her ears louder than the dying turbine whine. A shard of rotor blade had punched through the cockpit glass; it quivered inches from her cheek, catching the strobing orange of the fire that licked along the fuel slick. Her left shoulder throbbed\\u2014dislocated on impact\\u2014and every heartbeat felt like a hammer against bone. The concussion fuzzed everything at the edges, turning the smoke into watercolor smears.\\n\\nShe clawed for the buckle with her good arm, the nylon strap slick with her own blood. Metal groaned overhead; the fuselage had come to rest at a forty-five-degree angle, tail buried in a thicket of spruce. Through the cracked windshield she could see the pregnant teen, unconscious but breathing, still strapped to the stretcher that had somehow stayed locked to the floor. Outside, pine needles hissed as they caught fire.\\n\\nHer phone buzzed in the breast pocket of her flight suit. It should have been impossible\\u2014no signal this deep in the hills\\u2014but the screen lit anyway: an encrypted video, sender unknown. Time stamp 14:37. She thumbed it open with a shaking thumb.\\n\\nThe image was grainy green, night-vision inside a freight container. Luna sat cross-legged, wrists zip-tied, a strip of duct tape over her eyes. Beside her, a smaller figure\\u2014Min, Caro\\u2019s boy\\u2014breathed through a plastic straw jammed into a water bottle. A gloved hand adjusted the angle, and a distorted voice began to sing, the syllables mangled by auto-tune and static: \\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s heart stopped mid-beat. The lullaby their mother had sung in two languages, the one no one else alive knew. The voice finished the line and switched to a metallic rasp: \\u201cCome back to the river where you buried the truth. Forty-eight hours. Alone.\\u201d\\n\\nThe video ended. The phone blanked to black, reflecting her own soot-streaked face. Somewhere outside the wreck, a fuel tank popped like a gunshot. Isa fumbled for the buckle again, shoulder screaming, every motion sending shards of light across her vision. She had to get out. She had to run.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nFour thousand miles east, Seoul pressed noon sunlight into the floor-to-ceiling windows of Caro\\u2019s penthouse like polished brass. The apartment smelled of cedar shavings and orchids\\u2014three dozen rare white Phalaenopsis she had arranged on mirrored trays for a client tour. Each pot was balanced on slim steel stands, the petals so perfect they looked carved from porcelain.\\n\\nHer phone chimed. 14:37. The same encrypted video. She watched Luna and Min in the green glow, the straw trembling with each shallow breath. The lullaby clawed its way up her throat\\u2014she hadn\\u2019t heard it in twenty years.\\n\\nThe orchid she was holding slipped. Ceramic cracked against marble, potting mix blooming across the floor like dark snow. One by one the rest followed, domino-slow: stems snapping, roots exposed, perfume thick as loss.\\n\\nFrom the hallway came the elevator chime. Footsteps\\u2014more than one set\\u2014soft-soled shoes on lacquered oak. Caro turned, still clutching the ruined orchid, and saw the men in surgical masks framed against the light. Their eyes were flat, identical behind the white cloth.\\n\\nThe tallest held up his phone, the same frozen frame of Luna and Min onscreen. \\u201cTime\\u2019s already moving,\\u201d he said in Korean. \\u201cThe river remembers.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s knees buckled. Petals crunched beneath her heels as she sank to the floor, the lullaby echoing in her head louder than the breaking world around her.\\n\\nThe Line 2 train bursts from the tunnel into daylight above the Han River, windows flashing silver. Min grips the overhead rail, sneakers dangling inches above briefcases and designer boots. The smell of kimchi jjigae from someone\\u2019s lunchbox mixes with perfume and sweat. A phone rings with the same BTS ringtone as yesterday, and Min mouths the lyrics, counting stations until Gangnam\\u2014three more stops, then eomma\\u2019s orchids.\\n\\nA man in a navy suit staggers against him. The apology dies on Min\\u2019s lips when he sees the surgical mask, white against stubble, and eyes that look past him like he\\u2019s already gone. Another mask appears behind. White cotton, elastic straps, no words. Between heartbeats they close in.\\n\\nMin\\u2019s knuckles whiten on the rail. \\u201cAjussi\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nThe train lurches. Doors hiss. The first man\\u2019s hand clamps over Min\\u2019s mouth, tasting of latex and iron. The second slides an arm under his ribs, lifting. Min kicks; his sneaker strikes a metal pole with a hollow gong that nobody hears over the rush-hour roar. The masks move with choreographed calm, parting the crowd the way Moses split the sea. Passengers look down at phones, up at ads\\u2014anywhere but at the boy whose mouth is working soundlessly behind sterile fabric.\\n\\nThe doors start to close. Min\\u2019s fingers scrabble, catch the rubber edge. One fingernail peels back, hot and wet. A woman in a green hanbok finally glances up. Their eyes lock. Help me, Min screams without sound. Her gaze slides away.\\n\\nThey step off at Seolleung, masks bobbing like mushrooms. Min\\u2019s last glimpse of the train is his own reflection in the window, mouth stretched wide beneath the stranger\\u2019s palm, while inside the car a child keeps humming the BTS chorus he\\u2019ll never finish.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThree hundred feet above the Black Forest, the Eurocopter\\u2019s rotors beat the winter air into cold cream. Inside the cabin, Isa presses two fingers to the pregnant girl\\u2019s carotid\\u2014thready but there. Sweat mats the girl\\u2019s dark hair to the olive-drab stretcher; her belly rises like a hill under the thermal blanket. The medic beside her adjusts the IV drip with gloved hands. Out the window, fir trees scroll past in dark ranks.\\n\\n\\u201cFive minutes to Ramstein,\\u201d Klaus calls through the headset, voice tinny over the turbines. The pilot\\u2019s blond stubble catches the console\\u2019s green glow. \\u201cWeather\\u2019s holding.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa nods, though every muscle is braced for turbulence. She\\u2019s flown this route four times this month\\u2014Mosul to Ramstein, shrapnel to incubators. Routine, they call it, as if any flight carrying a fifteen-year-old mother and her unborn child can be routine.\\n\\nThe missile hits without sound. Just a white streak, a cough of smoke from the treeline, and then the world tilts.\\n\\nThe tail rotor disintegrates in a spray of carbon fiber and sparks. The helicopter whips sideways, centrifugal force flinging the medic into the ceiling. The IV bag bursts, saline glittering like glass in the sudden sunlight as the fuselage rolls. Isa\\u2019s seatbelt bites her collarbone; something pops hot and wrong in her shoulder.\\n\\nKlaus\\u2019s hands blur over the cyclic, feet working pedals that no longer answer. The forest rushes up\\u2014a mosaic of pine and snow. The girl screams, high and thin, joining the mechanical shriek of dying engines.\\n\\n\\u201cBrace!\\u201d Klaus shouts, but the word is already behind them.\\n\\nMetal screams. Trees explode into splinters. The world folds in on itself, glass and blood and the smell of aviation fuel. Isa\\u2019s cheek smashes against the window; through spiderweb cracks she sees a red deer bounding away, untouched, while fire blooms in the rearview mirror of her retina.\\n\\n*\\n\\n14:36:57. In Seoul, the surgical masks hustle Min down a stairwell that smells of urine and wet concrete. His reflection stutters across broken tiles\\u2014small, dark-haired, drowning in adult arms.\\n\\n14:36:58. In Germany, the helicopter\\u2019s belly skids across a clearing, rotors chewing earth until one snaps and cartwheels into the underbrush like a guillotine.\\n\\n14:37:00. Both phones buzz with the same silent alert. A notification neither sister has the hands to check.\\n\\nThe deer vanishes between the trees. The subway doors seal shut. Somewhere in the static between two countries, a lullaby begins to play.\\n\\nBlack Forest, Germany\\nRotor blades still cough sparks into the pine needles when Isa\\u2019s phone vibrates in the blood-warm pocket of her flight suit. She is on her knees, shoulder out of socket, helmet cracked like an eggshell. Smoke coils between the trunks, bitter with aviation fuel and scorched aluminum. Somewhere behind her, the co-pilot is screaming, but the sound is underwater, distant. Her left ear rings; her right ear hears only the soft electronic chime of an incoming Signal message.\\n\\nThe screen lights up with the same blue-white glow that once guided their childhood flashlight tag through the bamboo groves of Yongin. A thumbnail: a freight container, interior lit by a single LED strip. She taps it, hands shaking.\\n\\nThe video opens to Luna on the left, Min on the right. Both blindfolded in gray duct tape. Both wrists zip-tied to a metal pipe running overhead. A clear drinking straw has been taped into each of their mouths like obscene snorkels. Their chests rise and fall in shallow, panicked beats, fogging the straws with condensation.\\n\\nA voice, genderless, flattened through a cheap filter, recites the sentence that once lulled them to sleep.\\n\\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec.\\u201d\\nFrench first, Korean second. The cadence is exact, down to the half-second pause their mother always took between languages.\\n\\nThen the voice hardens: \\u201cReturn to the river where you buried the truth. You have until the moon turns its face.\\u201d\\n\\nThe clip ends. The forest wind rushes back in, carrying the smell of pine sap and burning rubber.\\n\\nIsa doesn\\u2019t scream. She simply stops breathing for five full seconds, eyes fixed on the black playback triangle, until the screen dims and reflects her own soot-streaked face. She feels the dislocated shoulder throb in its socket, but the pain is a postcard from another country. Her mind is already moving\\u2014measuring distances, calculating borders, hearing the echo of a summer night twelve years ago when three sisters swore an oath beneath dragonfly wings and neon water.\\n\\nShe pockets the phone, staggers to her feet, and starts limping downhill toward the nearest logging road. Every step drags a memory behind it like a parachute.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nGangnam-gu, Seoul\\nCaro sets the last dendrobium into a crystal cylinder when the phone on the marble counter illuminates. The penthouse is all glass and winter light; the Han River glitters twenty-seven floors below like a cracked mirror. A string quartet rehearses softly on the built-in speakers\\u2014Debussy, because orchids like impressionism, her housekeeper once joked.\\n\\nShe sees the same thumbnail, same glow. Her manicured thumb hesitates over it, the oval nail catching a prism of reflected sun. Then she taps.\\n\\nThe video plays. Min\\u2019s small face is turned toward the lens, freckles stark against the gray tape. His straw twitches with every terrified gasp. Luna is beside him, older, paler, but Caro recognizes the birthmark under the blindfold\\u2019s edge\\u2014the faint crescent that always reminded her of a rice grain.\\n\\nThe lullaby line curls out of the phone\\u2019s speaker like a phantom ribbon.\\n\\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s knees unlock. The orchid tray tilts, slides, crashes in a porcelain avalanche that sends water cascading across the heated marble. A single purple blossom lands upside down, stamens trembling like antennae.\\n\\n\\u201cReturn to the river where you buried the truth.\\u201d\\n\\nThe voice is a scalpel now, peeling back years of careful lacquer. Caro sees the river\\u2014not the Han gliding below, but the narrow, algae-threaded stream behind their grandmother\\u2019s house. She hears the shovel bite wet earth, the hush of three voices making a secret permanent.\\n\\nThe screen goes black. The Debussy continues, oblivious.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s hand hovers above the shattered orchids. A bead of blood pearls where a ceramic shard has sliced her index finger. She watches it fall\\u2014red on white, like the flag of a country that no longer exists.\\n\\nWithout wiping her hand, she crosses to the floor-to-ceiling window. In the mirrored glass, her reflection is cut in half by the city skyline. She lifts the phone again, types a single word to Isa\\u2014coordinates only, no greeting\\u2014and hits send.\\n\\nThe distance between them was never an ocean. It was a grave.\\n\\nThe elevator dings softly in the hallway, ready.\\n\\nEnd of Scene 4\\n\\nThe heat hits first\\u2014wet asphalt baking under rotor fuel\\u2014then the smell: scorched pine sap, burnt flesh, and the metallic tang of cordite threading through cold October rain. Isa tastes all of it while she claws across the shredded cockpit, left arm dangling like a snapped cable. Her shoulder had popped on impact; every heartbeat shoves the ball of the joint farther out of its socket, but the pain is a distant radio station compared to the hiss of leaking avgas.\\n\\n\\u201cKlaus.\\u201d Voice cracked, not hers\\u2014too close to the scream she swallowed when the tail rotor disintegrated. She finds the pilot slumped against the cyclic, helmet caved on the left. Blood channels down his cheek, mixing with rain that drips through the ragged hole where the windshield used to be.\\n\\nShe wedges her right arm under his armpit, fingers slipping on the Nomex. The chopper groans\\u2014aluminum ribs protesting like a dying animal. Better to drag them both out now than wait for the fire to decide their exit strategy. She plants her boots on the buckled instrument panel, knees trembling, and pulls.\\n\\nSomething tears in her shoulder\\u2014hot copper wire through muscle\\u2014but Klaus slides six inches closer to the doorframe. Another heave. The world tilts, concussion ringing church bells between her ears, but she keeps the rhythm: inhale, brace, drag. Each exhale steams in the frigid air before the rain erases it.\\n\\nFuel pools under the belly, rainbow slicks swirling over pine needles. One spark and they\\u2019ll be barbecue in dress blues. She tastes fuel on her tongue\\u2014thin, chemical\\u2014and forces herself to move faster. Another yard. Klaus\\u2019s boot snags on the doorframe; she kicks it free, then rolls them both into the underbrush.\\n\\nThe helicopter sighs, metal cooling fast. Smoke curls into the dripping canopy like incense gone wrong. Isa collapses chest-first onto sodden leaves, shoulder screaming, breath sawing. Rain needles her scalp, washing soot into her eyes.\\n\\nShe checks Klaus\\u2014pulse steady, skull fracture probable. No exit wound. Good. Then she wills herself upright.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s when she sees it, half-buried under a smoldering blue spruce: a jagged shard of metal no bigger than a dinner plate, edges still glowing. Cyrillic lettering stamped along the inner curve, the paint scorched but readable. Isa\\u2019s throat closes.\\n\\nShe knows the script from field hospitals outside Grozny, from the crates the rebels never bothered to relabel. Not some stray MANPAD from the desert. This came east\\u2014deliberate, tracked. Someone wanted them down.\\n\\nHer phone buzzes against her hip. 14:37. Unknown caller. The screen shows a thumbnail: Luna blindfolded, wrists zip-tied, breathing through a plastic straw. A distorted voice loops three seconds of childhood French-Korean lullaby, then cuts to static.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s hand tightens on the shard, Cyrillic letters branding her palm. Cold rain drums on the metal like morse code.\\n\\nBehind her, Klaus moans\\u2014soft, almost apologetic. She shoves the shard into her pocket, wipes blood off her lip, and starts the countdown in her head.\\n\\nFive minutes to find signal. Ten to reach Ramstein med-evac. Then the river. Always the river.\\n\\nShe braces her good arm under Klaus\\u2019s shoulders and hauls him deeper into the forest, boots squelching, rain washing the crash site into a watercolor blur. Somewhere ahead, a logging road, a radio, a way back to the coordinates buried under decades of silence.\\n\\nThe lullaby keeps playing in her skull\\u2014off-tempo, vowels stretched like taffy. Isa clenches her teeth and walks faster, shoulder grinding, the Black Forest closing in like a green fist.\\n\\nThe orchids had been perfect\\u2014phalaenopsis in pearl white, potted in black river stones, their roots glistening like wet bone. Caro had arranged them herself at dawn, tweezing each stem into place while Min practiced his hanja at the kitchen counter, tongue poking from the corner of his mouth. Now the tray slips from her fingers as if gravity has doubled, orchids cartwheeling through the air in slow motion.\\n\\nPorcelain bursts against marble with a sound like ice breaking over deep water. Potting mix sprays across the floor in dark, wet applause. A shard spins up, kisses her right palm, and keeps spinning. Blood beads, fat as pomegranate seeds, before gravity reasserts itself and they roll down her wrist in hot streaks.\\n\\nThe tablet lies three feet away, screen cracked but still alive. Min\\u2019s reflection flickers inside it\\u2014nine years old, cheeks round with baby fat, blindfold white as surgical gauze. The straw between his lips trembles with every breath.\\n\\n\\u201cDors, mon tr\\u00e9sor, \\uc790\\uc7a5\\uac00\\ub97c \\ubd88\\ub7ec,\\u201d the voice drones, electronic and sexless, as if the lullaby were being sung by the air itself.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s knees hit the floor hard enough to bruise. She doesn\\u2019t feel it. Her fingers, slick with blood, crawl toward the screen. They hover over Min\\u2019s face, afraid to touch, terrified to discover he\\u2019s only two-dimensional.\\n\\nThe timestamp burns in the corner: 14:37. She has watched it loop four times now. Each cycle ends with the same instruction: Return to the river where you buried the truth.\\n\\nRiver.\\n\\nHer mind snags on the word like fabric on barbed wire. There is only one river that ever mattered. The Rhine, slate-gray and fast beneath the Hohenzollern Bridge, its surface chopped into silver scales by the wind. The night she and Isa stood on the pedestrian walkway, seventeen years old, sharing a cigarette they didn\\u2019t want and a secret they couldn\\u2019t carry. The night they swore never to speak of it again\\u2014not to each other, not to anyone.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s reflection blurs in the black screen. The woman staring back is flawless until the blood drips off her chin and mars the image. Somewhere below, Seoul honks and blinks, a circuit board of neon and ambition. Up here, the air smells of broken stems and spilled soil, humid, sweet, rotting.\\n\\nShe tries to stand. Her legs refuse. Instead she crawls forward, knees grinding into porcelain grit, and drags the tablet closer. The video restarts. Min\\u2019s small chest rises, falls. The straw whistles.\\n\\n\\u201cMom,\\u201d she whispers to the empty penthouse, because there is no one else left to hear. \\u201cI\\u2019m coming.\\u201d\\n\\nThe word tastes foreign\\u2014Mom\\u2014not the elegant eomma she trained Min to use, but the raw, childish desperation she thought she\\u2019d outgrown. Blood smears across the screen as she swipes, searching for metadata, GPS, anything. Nothing. Whoever took him knew how to scrub a feed clean.\\n\\nOutside, the Han River glints between skyscrapers, a dull ribbon of light. Not the Rhine. Not the right river. But close enough to mock her.\\n\\nCaro presses her bleeding palm to the cool marble. The pain grounds her, sharp and bright. She breathes through it, counting heartbeats. One, two, three\\u2014\\n\\nShe rises. Glass crunches under her Louboutins. The orchids lie in pieces, petals bruised purple at the edges like fingerprints. She steps over them, leaving bloody half-moons on the floor.\\n\\nIn the bedroom she yanks a duffel from the closet. Passport, cash, burner phone\\u2014she\\u2019s never unpacked the go-bag since the last time. The last time she swore she\\u2019d never run again.\\n\\nThe tablet is still playing when she returns. Min\\u2019s shoulders jerk; someone off-screen adjusts the straw. A freight-container echo hollows every breath. Caro pauses the video on his face, captures the still, sends it to an encrypted server in Luxembourg, then wipes the tablet clean with the tail of her silk blouse.\\n\\nShe slings the duffel over her shoulder. At the elevator, she hesitates, looks back. The penthouse gleams\\u2014white leather, chrome, orchid petals like fallen wings. A life curated to withstand any tremor.\\n\\nThe tremor has come from inside.\\n\\nAs the doors close, Caro catches her reflection one last time: hair still immaculate, blood drying in elegant streaks down her forearm. She looks like a woman who has already crossed a border and isn\\u2019t sure she\\u2019ll be allowed back.\\n\\nThe elevator descends. Seoul recedes above her, a hive of light. Somewhere over the Pacific, Isa is crawling from a fire she doesn\\u2019t yet know is connected. Somewhere in a box on a truck, Min is counting breaths.\\n\\nCaro closes her eyes. The lullaby loops in her head, half French, half Korean, wholly theirs. She mouths the next line\\u2014the one the voice didn\\u2019t speak\\u2014and tastes seventeen again, river wind biting her cheeks, Isa\\u2019s hand slippery in hers as they dropped the bundle into the current and watched it sink.\\n\\nThe elevator dings. Lobby. She steps out, heels steady now. Outside, a black car waits, engine idling. She doesn\\u2019t remember calling it, but she climbs in anyway.\\n\\n\\u201cAirport,\\u201d she says. \\u201cLufthansa. First flight to Frankfurt.\\u201d\\n\\nThe driver nods, pulls into traffic. Seoul blurs into streaks of red and white. Caro opens her hand. The cut is deeper than she thought, a pale canyon across her lifeline. Blood wells, slow and deliberate.\\n\\nShe presses it to the window, leaving a small, perfect print. A signature. A promise.\\n\\nThe river is waiting.\\n\\n# Chapter 2: Along the 37th Parallel\\n\\nThe wind off the Hunsr\\u00fcck whipped rain sideways, needling the skin like ground glass. Sodium lamps glazed the wet concrete in fractured gold, and the twin-engine Beechcraft glistened like it had been dipped in mercury. Under its wing, a woman in a dove-gray trench coat stood motionless, clutching a slim leather folio against her ribs as though keeping her heart from leaping out. Dr. Isadora Mendoza\\u2014half-Spaniard, half-Korean, all fury\\u2014hadn\\u2019t waited inside the terminal. She wanted to meet Caro on neutral ground, where the cameras ended and the sky began.\\n\\nHeadlights knifed through the curtain of rain. A black BMW emergency-braked beside the plane, tires hissing. The rear door opened and Park Caro unfolded herself\\u2014taller than memory, black hair shorn to a severe bob, army surplus jacket over a hanbok collar the color of bruised plums. She carried nothing. She had never believed in baggage.\\n\\nFor a second the only sound was the ticking of cooling engines and the wet slap of wind against fuselage. Then Caro\\u2019s boots crunched across the tarmac, each step measured, deliberate. Isa\\u2019s knuckles whitened on the folio.\\n\\nFifteen years, and the first word belonged to the weather.\\n\\n\\u201cThey said it would be sleet,\\u201d Caro said, voice flat, as though the forecast had personally betrayed her.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t remember asking for a reunion tour,\\u201d Isa replied. Rain beaded on her lashes; she refused to blink.\\n\\nA silhouette ducked out of the cockpit\\u2014broad shoulders, bomber jacket, gray stubble cut sharp along the jawline. Klaus Reuter tossed a pair of chocks onto the ground like dice. \\u201cLadies,\\u201d he called, Bavarian vowels rounding the word into something almost warm, \\u201cthis bird is fueled and filed. If you intend to stand here until pneumonia sets in, kindly do it on your own medical insurance.\\u201d\\n\\nNeither sister moved.\\n\\nJi-eun emerged from the shadows near the cargo hatch, neon pink raincoat blinding under the floodlights. She balanced a tablet in one hand and a bubble-tea straw between her teeth. At twenty-four she had already rerouted three world tours through monsoons and visa strikes; nothing about tonight seemed to dent her gloss. She tapped the screen, and a green holographic grid floated above it like spilled coolant.\\n\\n\\u201cCoordinate packet decrypted,\\u201d she chirped. \\u201cOur ghost left us a breadcrumb\\u201449.4875\\u00b0 N, 8.4669\\u00b0 E. That\\u2019s the Konrad Adenauer Bridge, Mannheim. Twelve-minute flight time if we skip de-ice.\\u201d She offered the tablet to Isa, then seemed to think better and angled it toward Caro instead. Diplomacy through gadget placement.\\n\\nCaro glanced at the numbers, lips compressing. \\u201cMom\\u2019s bridge,\\u201d she said. The words cracked like thawing ice.\\n\\nIsa flinched almost imperceptibly. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t know this is about her.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s laugh scraped. \\u201cOf course not. Random psychopaths always scatter GPS poetry over the Rhine.\\u201d\\n\\nKlaus stepped between them, palms raised. \\u201cMy hangar, my rules. Grief later, altitude now. Mendoza, your medical kit\\u2019s aboard. Park, I\\u2019ve got a thermos of yuja-cha that hasn\\u2019t gone cold yet. Both of you\\u2014inside before customs wonders why a retired Bundeswehr pilot is running a midnight taxi service.\\u201d\\n\\nFor a heartbeat, the only thing louder than the rain was the sisters\\u2019 resistance. Then Caro moved first, brushing past Isa close enough that the wool of their coats snagged for an instant, a static spark snapping between them. Isa smelled the starched collar of her own lab coat under the trench, the ghost of antiseptic she could never quite scrub off. Caro smelled of wet camellia and gun oil.\\n\\nInside the cabin, amber LEDs glowed like embers. Ji-eun slid into the jump seat behind the cockpit, already scrolling Russian rail-cam footage. Klaus sealed the hatch, muffling the storm to a wet heartbeat against aluminum. Isa buckled herself opposite Caro at the small fold-out table; the distance between their knees was exactly the width of the folio Isa set down like a barrier.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s gaze tracked to the folio. \\u201cStill forging paperwork?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cStill collecting evidence,\\u201d Isa countered. She flicked the clasp, revealing a single photograph inside: two girls on a ferry railing, Han River glittering behind them, one laughing, one already looking away. She snapped it shut again.\\n\\nKlaus\\u2019s voice floated back from the cockpit. \\u201cFlight time eleven minutes. Seatbelts or not, we\\u2019re wheels-up in thirty.\\u201d\\n\\nJi-eun swiveled her screen toward them. A grainy CCTV still: a teal freight container stenciled with the letters \\u041c\\u0421\\u041a-4721, riding flatbed 07 on the Trans-Siberian, timestamped three hours ago. \\u201cHana\\u2019s ghosting the cams,\\u201d Ji-eun said. \\u201cTrain\\u2019s heading east, velocity steady. If we keep leapfrogging, we intercept in Vladivostok before customs clears the manifest.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s jaw worked. \\u201cHow old is your daughter?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cEight,\\u201d Isa whispered.\\n\\n\\u201cMine\\u2019s ten.\\u201d Caro stared at the aisle floor as if she could bore straight through to the rails beneath. \\u201cThey\\u2019re scared and moving toward the edge of the world. We don\\u2019t have time for your righteous silence.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s reply was cut short by the engines winding up, a low moan that climbed into a howl. The plane lurched forward, rain streaking sideways across the windows like silver scars. As they rolled onto the runway, cabin lights dimmed to tactical red. On the table between them, Ji-eun set a small waterproof capsule no bigger than a shotgun shell\\u2014the kind divers use for car keys. She nudged it across until it touched both of their hands.\\n\\n\\u201cFound this taped to the underside of the flap actuator,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t there at pre-flight.\\u201d\\n\\nThrough the translucent casing glinted a flash drive and a folded slip of hanja inked in blood-red brushstrokes. Caro\\u2019s breath hitched; Isa felt it in her own lungs, a twin catch.\\n\\nThe Beechcraft lifted, the ground falling away into black mosaic. Somewhere below, the Rhine coiled like a steel ribbon. Ahead, the 37th Parallel waited, a scar across continents and memory.\\n\\nCaro unfolded the slip with trembling fingers. The lullaby\\u2014first line in their mother\\u2019s hand. Isa read over her shoulder, translating in a whisper neither of them had meant to share:\\n\\n\\u201cLittle boats set sail before dawn\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\nThey looked at each other, rain still dripping from their hair, engines hammering toward Mannheim, and for a moment the resentment was eclipsed by something colder: recognition.\\n\\nThe hangar doors groaned shut behind them, sealing out the rain and the whine of departing cargo jets. Sodium lamps buzzed overhead, washing the corrugated metal walls in bruise-colored light. A single Cessna 340 sat on the oil-stained concrete like a patient predator, its props still dripping. Between the plane\\u2019s nose and a stack of palletized freight, two trestle tables had been pushed together to make an impromptu war room.\\n\\nKlaus smoothed the map with the heel of his hand. The paper crackled, loud in the hush of the hangar. A red grease-pencil line ran east-west across Europe, kissing coastlines and mountain ranges before diving into Asia. Tiny black triangles marched along it\\u2014waypoints, numbered but unnamed.\\n\\n\\u201cThirty-seven degrees north,\\u201d Klaus said, tapping the line. \\u201cYour mother used to call it the seam between worlds. Tonight we follow it east, one checkpoint at a time, until the kidnapper tells us to stop.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro leaned in. Rainwater slid from the brim of her cap onto the map, beading on the laminated surface. \\u201cCheckpoint one is Mannheim?\\u201d Her voice was hoarse from the cold, but steady.\\n\\n\\u201cRhine kilometer three-sixty-nine,\\u201d Ji-eun confirmed. She wore the same leather bomber she\\u2019d had since Kosovo, patches faded to gray. In her gloved fingers she held a brushed-steel capsule no larger than a .50-caliber round. \\u201cWe lifted this off the drone that overflew Hahn an hour ago. Waterproof, pressure-proof. Whoever sent it knew we\\u2019d be here.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa stood a pace behind her sister, arms folded so tight her knuckles blanched. The borrowed parka smelled of jet fuel and someone else\\u2019s cigarettes. \\u201cMannheim,\\u201d she repeated, tasting iron. \\u201cYou mean the bridge where we\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhere we dumped Mom\\u2019s ashes, yes.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s chin lifted. \\u201cDon\\u2019t say dumped, Isa. She asked us to scatter them there. You were too busy catching your flight to Seoul to remember the exact wording.\\u201d\\n\\nThe words hit like buckshot. Isa felt the sting travel all the way to her wrists. \\u201cI had orders,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMedical rotation at Yongsan. I told you a hundred times\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWhile my brother was bleeding out near Cheorwon,\\u201d Caro snapped. \\u201cBut sure, save the ones who can pay.\\u201d\\n\\nKlaus cleared his throat. \\u201cLadies, we have maybe six hours before the container crosses the Ukrainian border. If you\\u2019re going to knife each other, do it after we\\u2019re airborne.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa stepped to the table, forcing herself to look at the map instead of Caro\\u2019s face. The grease-pencil line passed through places she\\u2019d only seen from a helicopter gunship: the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the empty quarter north of Vladivostok. At the edge of the paper someone had written a string of coordinates in Ji-eun\\u2019s tidy engineer\\u2019s script\\u201449.4875\\u00b0 N, 8.4669\\u00b0 E. Mannheim. A small black star marked the spot.\\n\\nJi-eun unscrewed the capsule. Inside lay a thumb drive and a slip of rice paper folded into a square. She tweezed the paper out with forceps and laid it flat. Hanja characters glimmered like fish scales under the lamps.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s breath caught. \\u201cThat\\u2019s Mom\\u2019s handwriting.\\u201d\\n\\nJi-eun angled the paper toward them. \\u201cI can\\u2019t read it,\\u201d she admitted. \\u201cBut the drive\\u2019s labeled with the same characters.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s throat closed. She recognized the first character\\u2014moon\\u2014followed by one she\\u2019d never bothered to learn. A childhood memory surfaced: their mother humming against her ear, tracing the shapes on her palm so Isa could fall asleep on the Seoul subway. She\\u2019d called hanja \\u201cself-indulgent grief\\u201d once, loud enough for Caro to hear. The fight that followed had lasted a week.\\n\\nCaro reached for the paper, then stopped, fingers hovering. \\u201cRead it,\\u201d she said to Isa, voice low. \\u201cYou always insisted you forgot.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t forget,\\u201d Isa muttered. \\u201cI just\\u2014\\u201d She swallowed. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to remember.\\u201d\\n\\nSilence stretched until the lamps seemed to buzz louder. Klaus shifted his weight, boots scuffing concrete.\\n\\nJi-eun broke it. She spoke the line aloud, syllable by syllable, her pronunciation clipped but careful. \\u201cDal-bit\\u2026 mul-eul\\u2026 geu-ri-go\\u2026\\u201d Moonlight on the water, longing for\\u2026 something. Isa couldn\\u2019t parse the last measure. The rice paper trembled between Ji-eun\\u2019s forceps like a living thing.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s eyes glistened, but her tone was flat. \\u201cShe used to sing that when you had night terrors. After Dad died. You\\u2019d wake up screaming and she\\u2019d rock you, singing about moonlight and the river, telling you the dead could still hear us if we spoke their names.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa felt the hangar tilt. The concrete seemed to ripple under her boots. \\u201cI was eight,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know what any of it meant.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut you knew enough to erase it.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s voice cracked. \\u201cJust like you erased Korea, erased us.\\u201d\\n\\nJi-eun slid the drive into a hardened tablet. The screen woke, casting blue light across their faces. A 1996 Red Cross crest appeared, pixelated but unmistakable. Below it: OPERATION WHITE PINE \\u2013 RESTRICTED. She angled the tablet so both sisters could see.\\n\\n\\u201cWhatever\\u2019s on this,\\u201d Ji-eun said, \\u201cit ties your mother to a massacre. And the kidnapper wants you to watch it together. Now.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand, smearing mascara across her cheek. \\u201cFine. We watch. Then we go to Mannheim. But understand this, Isa: every step we take, you carry the weight of what you walked away from.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa met her gaze, something hard crystallizing behind her own exhaustion. \\u201cI carried plenty, Caro. Just because I didn\\u2019t bleed in the same mud doesn\\u2019t mean I didn\\u2019t bleed.\\u201d\\n\\nKlaus folded the map with military precision, creases sharp enough to cut. \\u201cBleed on your own time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWeather window closes in forty minutes. You can kill each other after we\\u2019re wheels-up, but right now we move.\\u201d\\n\\nHe snapped off the overhead lamps, plunging them into the dim glow of emergency strips. The Cessna\\u2019s door yawned open like a mouth. Isa grabbed her duffel, the weight of the drive and the rice paper suddenly heavier than body armor.\\n\\nCaro was already climbing the airstair. She paused halfway, looking back. \\u201cMoonlight on the water,\\u201d she said. \\u201cKeep humming it, Isa. Maybe the dead will forgive you.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa followed, rain misting through the open door onto her face, tasting of runway salt and something else\\u2014ashes, maybe, or memory. She didn\\u2019t answer, but the tune was already threading itself behind her teeth, soft as breath, relentless as the 37th parallel itself.\\n\\nThe props began to turn.\\n\\nThe wind comes off the Rhine like a slap, slicing through Isa\\u2019s coat and carrying the smell of diesel and wet stone. She grips the railing, knuckles whitening. Below, the river slides black and wide beneath the iron lattice of the bridge, its surface freckled by rain.\\n\\nCaro stands ten feet away at the opposite parapet, one boot hooked on the lowest rung of the maintenance ladder that snakes down into the girders. She doesn\\u2019t look back when she speaks. \\u201c49.4875 North, 8.4669 East. This is it. Exact middle of the span.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s mouth tastes of metal. She hasn\\u2019t stood here since the day they opened their mother\\u2019s urn and the ashes scattered like pale wings\\u2014fine enough to ride the updraft, coarse enough that some grains stuck to her wet lashes. That was fifteen years ago, the same autumn chill, the same river hush. Same guilt.\\n\\nCaro descends two rungs. Ice crackles under her gloves. \\u201cYou coming or just cataloging regrets?\\u201d\\n\\nIsa swallows. \\u201cI\\u2019m coming.\\u201d\\n\\nThe lattice is a skeleton of rust-red beams and cross-braces, slick with November rain. They climb sideways, backs to the water, boots wedging for purchase. Isa\\u2019s breath fogs the rivets. Each step knocks loose a memory: the soft weight of the urn in her arms, Caro\\u2019s voice cracking on the Korean prayer she never bothered to learn, the plink of bone fragments against the railing.\\n\\nHalfway down, Caro stops. \\u201cThere.\\u201d\\n\\nA finger-thick capsule, matte orange, clipped to a cable with a stainless-steel carabiner. It sways in the wind, tapping the iron like a heartbeat. Caro reaches first, fingers brushing it, then hesitates. \\u201cYou do it.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa blinks rain from her lashes. \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBecause you owe her more than I do.\\u201d\\n\\nThe words sting sharper than the wind. Isa unhooks the capsule. It\\u2019s heavier than expected, the plastic scored by cold. She thumbs the rubber gasket, feels the O-ring give. Inside: a thumb drive sealed in a tiny zip-bag and a folded square of rice paper.\\n\\nCaro climbs back up to the walkway. Isa follows, boots slipping once, the river yawning below. On the pavement they huddle under the weak orange glow of a sodium lamp. Rain drums the awning of a locked souvenir kiosk.\\n\\nCaro tears open the zip-bag with her teeth. The drive is unmarked, gunmetal gray. Isa unfolds the rice paper. Hanja characters bloom like bruises across the grain:\\n\\n\\uc7a0\\uc774 \\ub4e4\\uba74 / \\ubc14\\ub78c\\uacb0\\uc5d0 / \\uadf8\\ub9bc\\uc790 \\ud53c\\uace0\\nWhen you sleep / in the path of the wind / shadows take root\\n\\nHer throat locks. She hears the lullaby in their mother\\u2019s voice, the low hum she used when Seoul\\u2019s sirens went off and the blackout curtains couldn\\u2019t muffle the world. Isa had pretended not to know the words; easier to fake sleep than admit she understood every syllable and still enlisted under a forged medical waiver.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s voice is almost drowned by the rain. \\u201cShe wrote that the week before she left for Bosnia.\\u201d A pause. \\u201cYou never asked what it meant.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was nineteen,\\u201d Isa mutters. \\u201cI thought meaning was negotiable.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro wipes water from her brow with the heel of her hand. \\u201cLet\\u2019s see what else she left us.\\u201d\\n\\nShe pulls a rugged tablet from her coat, slots the drive. A folder opens: RC_96-11-17_Medak_Pocket_Redacted.pdf. The thumbnail shows a Red Cross crest, a stamp reading SECRET\\u2014EYES ONLY. Caro taps it. Lines of blacked-out Cyrillic and English scroll past. A photograph unblurs: a woman in blue coveralls, face obscured by a surgical mask, but the eyes\\u2014dark, certain\\u2014belong unmistakably to their mother.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s pulse skids. \\u201cShe was there. November \\u201996. Medak Pocket.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s reply is a whisper. \\u201cAnd she never told us.\\u201d\\n\\nBelow them a barge horn moans, low and mournful. Headlights sweep the bridge as a lone car crosses, tires hissing on wet asphalt. Isa folds the rice paper back into its square, creasing the edges like a prayer.\\n\\nCaro pockets the drive. \\u201cNext coordinate?\\u201d\\n\\nIsa checks the phone: 48.3026 N 14.2861 E. Danube, Linz. She angles the screen so Caro can see the blue pin hovering over Austria.\\n\\nCaro exhales a cloud of frost. \\u201cMore ghosts, then.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa almost smiles. \\u201cWe\\u2019re good at ghosts.\\u201d\\n\\nThey start back toward the rental car, footfalls syncing without meaning to. Behind them the bridge hums, the capsule\\u2019s empty carabiner still swinging like a pendulum marking time neither of them can get back.\\n\\nThe Mercedes Sprinter shuddered over a pothole, sending coffee sloshing against the travel-cup lid. Outside, the A6 sliced through vineyards glazed silver by the floodlights of passing trucks. Inside, the air felt thinner, like someone had cracked a window to November and left the grief inside to sour.\\n\\nJi-eun sat sideways on the wheel-well, laptop balanced on her knees, the flash drive pinched between latex-gloved fingers. Klaus drove one-handed, the other resting on a matte-black thigh holster he hadn\\u2019t bothered to hide since Mannheim. In the back, Caro and Isa knelt on opposite sides of a mil-spec crate, its lid open to reveal a folded tarp, nylon cuffs, and\\u2014now\\u2014the slim silver drive spinning mercilessly in the USB hub.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s breath fogged the cold glass of the sliding door. She watched the Neckar\\u2019s black ribbon appear and vanish between stands of frost-bitten poplars. Each mile felt like a seam ripping open inside her chest.\\n\\nJi-eun tapped a key. The screen blinked from encrypted static to pale institutional gray. A Red Cross emblem, 1996 vintage, jittered into focus.\\n\\n\\u201cFragment found,\\u201d Ji-eun said, voice almost apologetic. \\u201cAudio only. Ninety-three seconds.\\u201d\\n\\nThe van speakers crackled, then a woman\\u2019s calm European French:\\n\\u201c\\u2014the compound at Sajik-dong, 3 July 1950. Approximately 2100 hours. Mothers instructed to sing to prevent the children from crying\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\nA lullaby started underneath, soft, unmistakably Korean: the same melody their mother had hummed when fever kept Isa awake, the same Caro later mocked as \\u201ccheap sedation.\\u201d On the tape it warbled, overexposed, like wind through cracked church glass.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2014before the soldiers opened fire. Only two girls survived, hidden beneath the bodies. One was listed as Kim Eun-hee, age seven. The other\\u2019s name is redacted in this copy.\\u201d\\n\\nThe recording cut to static. Isa felt the sound in her teeth.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s fist closed around the tarp edge until the fabric bunched like pleated skin. \\u201cShe never told us.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe told us plenty,\\u201d Isa said, too quickly.\\n\\n\\u201cShe told bedtime stories. Not mass graves.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s voice scraped raw. She reached toward the keyboard; Ji-eun angled the screen away, protective. \\u201cYou never wanted the real stories. You called han \\u2018self-indulgent grief,\\u2019 remember? Signed your medical exemption, flew to Berlin, and left the rest of us to carry it.\\u201d\\n\\nThe accusation hung over the drone of tires.\\n\\nIsa swallowed. The coffee tasted like rust. \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve sent me to the DMZ to stitch up kids who stepped on mines. I couldn\\u2019t do it. I chose life\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou chose absence,\\u201d Caro snapped. \\u201cWhile my brother\\u2014\\u201d She broke off, pressing knuckles to her mouth. The name didn\\u2019t need saying; it lived between them like a third sibling who refused to leave the room.\\n\\nKlaus\\u2019s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, gauging threat levels. Ji-eun paused the playback, leaving the screen frozen on the Red Cross timestamp: 03-07-1950. The date glowed green, accusing.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s phone buzzed on the crate\\u2014unknown number, voice-scramble icon already spinning. She put it on speaker before thinking.\\n\\nA wash of digital gravel filled the van. Luna.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you like your mother\\u2019s lullaby in surround sound?\\u201d The voice modulated up, childlike, then plunged baritone. \\u201cNext verse awaits. Coordinates: 49.4875\\u00b0 N, 8.4669\\u00b0 E\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s where we just came from,\\u201d Klaus growled.\\n\\n\\u201cRecalculating,\\u201d Luna cooed. \\u201cApologies. New drop: 48.7758\\u00b0 N, 9.1829\\u00b0 E. Stuttgart-M\\u00fcnster. Midnight. Bring your passports; borders are thinning.\\u201d\\n\\nThe line clicked dead. Silence stretched, elastic and sour.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s reflection stared at Isa from the dark window: twin pairs of exhausted eyes, fifteen years of distance compressed into one vibrating moment. She spoke first, softer now. \\u201cThat redacted name. It\\u2019s her, isn\\u2019t it? Our mother.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s throat closed. She managed a nod.\\n\\nOutside, a road sign flashed: STUTTGART 47 km. The van\\u2019s speed crept up, tires humming a low lullaby of their own.\\n\\nJi-eun quietly closed the laptop. Klaus flicked on the high beams, cutting tunnels through the night. In the sudden cone of light, the next stretch of autobahn looked like an unhealed scar, and they were all just passengers on its back, heading east, always east, chasing the fragments of a song no one wanted to finish.\\n\\nThe civic\\u2019s headlights cut a dim tunnel through the fog rolling off the Neckar, silver needles of rain stabbing the windshield. Isa killed the engine beside a picnic pull-off whose tables squatted like darkened sarcophagi. Beyond the guardrail the river ran black and fast, its surface flicking light back at the sodium lamps. Klaus stepped out first, coat collar high, cigarette cupped in one hand. Ji-eun lingered near the hood, tablet glowing against the night.\\n\\nInside the car the dashboard clock read 02:17. Caro\\u2019s phone buzzed on the center console, speaker crackling.\\n\\n\\u201cMom, I\\u2019m in,\\u201d Hana said, voice thin with adrenaline. \\u201cRussian Railways subnet thought six-factor was enough\\u2014cute.\\u201d Rapid keystrokes sounded like hail on metal. \\u201cOkay, camera 14B just pinged the freight train at Omsk, timestamp twenty-three minutes ago. Same container ID: BGX-777-KR. Eastbound on the Trans-Sib mainline.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa leaned forward, damp hair brushing Caro\\u2019s shoulder. \\u201cETA to Vladivostok?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAt current speed\\u2014three days, ten hours, assuming no sidings or bribes. Satellite weather shows a storm front over the Urals; could add half a day.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro rubbed her temples. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll be neck-deep in Bavarian snow by then. Keep the feed open.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s chewing bandwidth,\\u201d Hana warned. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got a relay piggybacking a Roscosmos weather sat, but it\\u2019ll decay in four hours.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cFour hours is luxury,\\u201d Klaus muttered through the open window. Smoke ghosted around his words.\\n\\nJi-eun tapped the tablet. \\u201cNext coordinate from the capsule: 49.4875\\u00b0 N, 8.4669\\u00b0 E\\u2014that\\u2019s still Mannheim, but the Rhine crossing is behind us. The Neckar waypoint must be verification, not destination.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOr a breadcrumb,\\u201d Isa said. \\u201cLuna likes loops.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro opened the glove box and drew out the silver capsule they\\u2019d pried from the bridge lattice hours earlier. The flash drive dangled like a tiny sword. She stared at the Korean hanja etched inside the cap: \\uc7a0\\uc774 \\ub4e4\\uc5b4\\ub3c4 \\uafc8\\uc740 \\ub0a0\\uc544\\uac04\\ub2e4\\u2014Even in sleep, dreams take flight.\\n\\nA sudden hush fell, broken only by the river and the soft rustle of rain. Isa watched Caro trace the characters with a fingertip, the gesture hesitant, almost tender.\\n\\n\\u201cYou used to hum that line,\\u201d Caro said quietly, eyes still on the metal. \\u201cAt the hospital, after Dad left the second time. You were twelve, maybe thirteen. I hated you for sounding like Mom.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s throat worked. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know you were listening.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI hid on the landing.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s laugh was small, cracked. \\u201cYou sat on the piano bench in your school uniform, rocking like she used to. I thought if I came down, you\\u2019d stop, and I didn\\u2019t want the song to end.\\u201d\\n\\nRain drummed on the roof. Isa reached into her jacket and produced the folded page\\u2014Hana\\u2019s transcription of the lullaby fragments. She smoothed it against the steering wheel. \\u201cWe have two stanzas now. If the next line is at the Neckar, maybe the river keeps the rest.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cRivers don\\u2019t keep,\\u201d Caro said. \\u201cThey carry away.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa flinched but didn\\u2019t retreat. \\u201cThen let\\u2019s move before the current wins.\\u201d\\n\\nHeadlights flared behind them\\u2014Klaus, ready to roll. Ji-eun climbed into the back seat, tablet balanced on her knees like a prayer book. Caro twisted the key; the engine coughed awake. She eased onto the wet road, tires hissing. In the rearview the picnic tables receded, then vanished as fog swallowed them.\\n\\n\\u201cHana,\\u201d Caro said, \\u201cpatch the feed to the windshield HUD once we hit the autobahn. If the container stalls, I want to see it before the Russians do.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCopy. And Mom\\u2026 the lullaby.\\u201d A pause, soft as breath. \\u201cGrandma used to sing it to me over video chat. Same key you hum. Thought you should know.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s grip tightened on the wheel. The car crested the rise; ahead, the highway signs gleamed green and white. BADEN-W\\u00dcRTTEMBERG 42 KM.\\n\\nBeside her, Isa began to hum\\u2014low, tentative. The melody threaded the space between them, fragile as frost. Caro didn\\u2019t join, but her foot eased on the accelerator, matching the tempo. For the first time in a thousand kilometers, the silence felt less like a wall and more like a bridge.\\n\\nSomewhere beyond the river the container rattled east, carrying its red secret toward the Pacific. The sisters followed, one remembered note at a time.\\n\\n# Chapter 3: The Lever at the River\\u2019s End\\n\\nThe Dodge\\u2019s headlights died and silence rolled in on the wind, thick with the smell of iron and river ice. Caro killed the engine. The last few flakes hissed against the hood as if the truck itself were cooling off from the sprint across the border.\\n\\nIsa stepped out first, boots crunching through the glazed snow. Her breath came out in ragged clouds, each one a white flag. She didn\\u2019t look back at Caro\\u2014looking back felt like permission to hesitate. Instead she stared at the listening post.\\n\\nIt rose from the riverbank like something coughed up from the earth\\u2019s gut: corrugated walls the color of dried blood, windows punched out and black, antennae leaning at sick angles that reminded her of broken fingers after a bombing. One of the dishes still spun, squeaking faintly, as though trying to tune in a lullaby no one sang anymore.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s door slammed. The sound cracked down the valley, startling a murder of crows from the scrub. They wheeled once over the structure, then scattered toward the bruised horizon where the Tumen glimmered\\u2014half water, half mirror, half blade.\\n\\n\\u201cThirty-eight minutes,\\u201d Caro said, voice hoarse from the drive. She checked the cheap GPS watch strapped over her glove. \\u201cIf the file\\u2019s still on the countdown.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s fingers were already trembling, but not from cold. \\u201cHe said sunrise. It\\u2019s coming.\\u201d\\n\\nThe sky behind them bled from charcoal to gunmetal; somewhere behind the clouds the sun was lifting itself like a coin someone had lost at the bottom of a well. Dawn here never promised warmth\\u2014only clarity, and that was the worst part.\\n\\nCaro started toward the post. Her parka rasped against itself, the nylon loud in the hush. \\u201cYou smell that?\\u201d she asked without slowing.\\n\\n\\u201cCordite,\\u201d Isa answered. \\u201cAnd diesel. Someone\\u2019s been here.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s jaw twitched\\u2014the same tic she\\u2019d had as a kid when their mother caught them sneaking out. Isa remembered it from a lifetime ago, the two of them crawling across rooftop tiles in Busan, chasing rumors. Now they were chasing ghosts.\\n\\nThey reached the perimeter fence. A section had been peeled open with bolt cutters, edges bright with fresh metal. Through the gap, the path to the door had been trampled\\u2014single set of prints, small, deliberate. Not soldiers. One person, leading them exactly where they needed to go.\\n\\nCaro ducked first. Isa followed, snagging her sleeve on a twist of barbed wire. A bead of blood welled, black against the gray wool. She didn\\u2019t pause to staunch it; the pain felt deserved.\\n\\nUp close, the post exhaled rot: rust, wet concrete, and something underneath it like spoiled milk. Isa tasted bile. On the far side, the river whispered against ice plates, a wet knock of stone on stone. Somewhere under that sound, she swore she could hear Luna humming\\u2014one of the old Spanish lullabies Isa had sung to her when the nightmares came. A hallucination born of fear, but it lodged behind her ribs all the same.\\n\\nCaro pressed her palm to the metal door. \\u201cLocked from the inside,\\u201d she muttered. \\u201cHe wants us to knock.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s throat was raw. \\u201cLuna?\\u201d she called, the name cracking. \\u201cMin?\\u201d\\n\\nOnly wind answered, sliding across the corrugated roof like a hand looking for a throat.\\n\\nCaro slid the crowbar from under her coat. \\u201cWe do this fast. Get them, get out, let the river take the rest.\\u201d She wedged the bar under the latch. Metal shrieked. The door jerked outward an inch, exhaling a breath of stale heat and something sweeter\\u2014coppery. Blood or wires or both.\\n\\nIsa flinched. \\u201cHe\\u2019s inside with them. He wants a show.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen we give him one.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s voice was flat, the way surgeons speak when the patient\\u2019s already on the table and the heart is slowing. She heaved the bar again. The latch snapped with a sound like a collarbone breaking.\\n\\nThe door swung inward on groaning hinges. Beyond lay a throat of darkness stabbed by a single blue laptop glow. On the screen, the lullaby line pulsed\\u2014\\ud53c\\ub294 \\ubb3c\\ubcf4\\ub2e4 \\uc9c4\\ud558\\ub2e4, mais l\\u2019eau efface tout\\u2014like a heartbeat.\\n\\nCaro stepped over the threshold first. Isa caught her sleeve.\\n\\n\\u201cWhatever we choose,\\u201d Isa whispered, \\u201cwe do it together this time.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s eyes\\u2014black as the river water\\u2014met hers. For the first time since they\\u2019d left the safehouse, something unclenched in her face. Not hope, exactly, but the distant cousin of it: recognition.\\n\\n\\u201cTogether,\\u201d Caro echoed.\\n\\nBehind them, the sky brightened a fraction, a gray knife sliding between the clouds. Ahead, the laptop waited, and the children beyond it. The river kept its slow, endless conversation with the ice.\\n\\nCaro tightened her grip on Isa\\u2019s hand. They crossed the threshold together.\\n\\nCold metal presses against Luna\\u2019s cheek, smelling of diesel and old blood. She blinks, the dim light inside the container rippling like dirty water. Her wrists are taped together in front of her; Min lies a foot away, knees curled to his chest, mouth working against silver duct tape. The air tastes of rust and fear.\\n\\nA low beep\\u2014steady, patient\\u2014draws her eyes down. A square of yellow plastic glows between them, bolted to the floor. Seven red digits crawl downward: 09:43\\u202609:42\\u2026\\n\\nLuna\\u2019s stomach caves in. She scoots sideways, shoulder scraping corrugated iron, until the tape on her wrists rasps across Min\\u2019s ankle. He wakes with a muffled cry. She jerks her chin at the device. Min follows the motion, pupils blowing wide.\\n\\nThe bomb is nothing like movies. No bright wires or dramatic colors\\u2014just a slab of gray explosive the size of a hardcover book encased in clear epoxy. Beneath it, a wafer-thin pressure plate. A green LED blinks every time one of them breathes too deeply.\\n\\nLuna wiggles until she\\u2019s sitting. The motion makes the counter jump\\u201409:35. Min whimpers. She presses her bound hands to her lips, then points to the far end of the container. A laptop sits open on an upended crate, screen angled toward them like a confession booth.\\n\\nThey crab-walk sideways, knees skimming the trembling plate. Every shift of weight draws another beep, faster now, as if the bomb has a heartbeat. Sweat stings Luna\\u2019s eyes; cold air licks the back of her neck. At the crate, she rocks back on her heels and peers at the screen.\\n\\nCentered on black background, white letters spell the final line of the lullaby their mothers hummed on different continents:\\n\\n\\ud53c\\ub294 \\ubb3c\\ubcf4\\ub2e4 \\uc9c4\\ud558\\ub2e4, mais l\\u2019eau efface tout\\n(Blood is thicker than water, but water washes everything away)\\n\\nBeneath it: two rectangles, side by side.\\nUPLOAD\\u2003\\u2003|\\u2003\\u2003ABANDON\\n\\nA thin progress bar hovers at 99%. One touch, one choice.\\n\\nMin makes a strangled sound. Luna looks over. Tears streak the tape over his mouth; his nose bubbles. She lifts her bound wrists, brushes her knuckles across his cheek. The pressure plate chirps again\\u201408:57.\\n\\nThe container groans as wind slams the outer walls. Somewhere outside, a radio chatters in Korean, voice distorted by static. Luna imagines the river beyond the walls, black water sliding beneath ice, ready to swallow them or spare them.\\n\\nMin nods toward the laptop, then to their taped wrists. Luna turns back. A slim ridge on the crate\\u2019s edge catches the tape; she saws the silver strip against it, sawing, sawing, until the fibers part. Blood prickles back into her fingers. She peels the tape from Min\\u2019s mouth first; he gasps, \\u201cLuna\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShh.\\u201d She presses a finger to his lips, then to the glowing countdown. 08:11.\\n\\nMin stares at the screen. \\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s Mom\\u2019s report?\\u201d His voice cracks on \\u201cMom.\\u201d\\n\\nLuna nods. \\u201cIf it uploads, it saves everyone they couldn\\u2019t save in 1996. But\\u2014\\u201d She glances at the pressure plate. \\u201cMaybe the bomb is rigged to the upload. Or maybe it\\u2019s wired to the ABANDON button. We don\\u2019t know which is mercy.\\u201d\\n\\nMin\\u2019s fingers shake as he reaches toward the trackpad, then pulls back. \\u201cWhat if we do nothing?\\u201d\\n\\nThe counter answers: 07:52.\\n\\nLuna swallows. The lullaby line loops in her head\\u2014blood thicker than water, water washing everything away. She remembers her mother singing it in Spanish, Caro translating the French part against her hair. She remembers Min\\u2019s grandmother humming the same tune while ladling kimchi stew. One song, two rivers, one lie.\\n\\nShe leans closer. Beneath the progress bar, tiny text scrolls: Upload will complete automatically at 00:00 unless ABANDON is selected. Manual override required. She reads it aloud.\\n\\nMin\\u2019s face crumples. \\u201cSo if we let the timer run, it uploads and maybe blows us up. If we hit ABANDON, it might disarm the bomb but bury the report forever.\\u201d He wipes his nose on his sleeve. \\u201cWe\\u2019re the lever.\\u201d\\n\\nLuna\\u2019s heart thrums against her ribs. She thinks of Isa\\u2019s face above her in the hospital after the Lagos bombing, gentle hands stitching shrapnel cuts, whispering, Some choices cost more than we can carry. She thinks of Caro\\u2019s voice on the sat-phone, telling Luna bedtime stories while convoy headlights swept the desert night. Two mothers, one secret.\\n\\n06:33.\\n\\nA metallic scrape outside\\u2014the container doors? Footsteps circle, slow, deliberate. Whoever left them here is listening.\\n\\nMin touches the screen; the cursor trembles over UPLOAD. \\u201cIf we die, the world still learns the truth.\\u201d His voice is steadier than his hand. \\u201cIf we live and the report dies, the truth dies with us.\\u201d\\n\\nLuna covers his hand with hers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not bargaining chips,\\u201d she whispers, echoing the words she heard through the wall minutes ago or a lifetime ago. \\u201cWe choose for ourselves.\\u201d\\n\\n05:59.\\n\\nThe LED on the pressure plate flares, as if it hears them. Min breathes in, out. \\u201cTogether?\\u201d\\n\\nShe nods. Their fingers hover over the trackpad.\\n\\nOutside, the wind howls louder, rattling the antennae like dead trees clacking bones. The river keeps moving under the ice, patient, ancient.\\n\\nLuna closes her eyes. She pictures their mothers on opposite banks, waiting.\\n\\nShe counts the beeps\\u2014three, two, one\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014and the container doors burst open, gray light flooding in.\\n\\nThe overhead fluorescents flicker once and die, replaced by a single emergency strip that paints the control room the color of old iodine. Isa smells diesel exhaust trapped in the walls and her own sweat turning cold under borrowed Kevlar. Caro stands closer than breathing, but the space between them feels radioactive.\\n\\nA boot scrapes metal. From the stairwell\\u2019s throat a man unfolds, coat flaring like black wings. The pistol in his right hand is steady; the left holds a leather-bound notebook swollen by damp years. Snow crystals glitter in his hair and melt along the scar that lifts half his upper lip.\\n\\n\\u201cTwenty-seven winters I rehearsed this moment,\\u201d he says in Spanish that still carries Budapest vowels. \\u201cChoose the language you betrayed me in.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s exhale fogs the glass. \\u201cVarga.\\u201d The name lands like a dropped vial.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s mind rifles through trauma protocols\\u2014distance, angle, exit routes\\u2014but her feet stay nailed to the grating. She recognizes the notebook: their mother\\u2019s field log, last seen in a Chongjin clinic before the mortars hit.\\n\\nVarga circles until the barrel finds the exact spot between Caro\\u2019s shoulder blades where the scapula wings. \\u201cTell her what you told the tribunal, Doctora. How the North Koreans \\u2018insisted\\u2019 on directing our convoy. How you \\u2018had no choice\\u2019 but to leave the wounded behind.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cold makes Caro\\u2019s voice brittle. \\u201cWe were saving the ones we could.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBy locking the doors?\\u201d He flips the notebook open with his thumb; pages rustle like dry leaves. \\u201cPage forty-two. \\u2018Interpreter refuses evacuation, demands return for civilians.\\u2019 Your mother wrote that while you held the pen.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa tastes copper where her teeth meet her tongue. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know they\\u2019d shell the market.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut you knew they could.\\u201d Varga taps the pistol against Caro\\u2019s spine once, like punctuation. \\u201cAnd when the smoke cleared, you renamed it collateral damage, stamped it confidential, flew home to your boards and your awards. While I spent three years in a mining camp learning how thin a man can get.\\u201d\\n\\nOutside, wind rattles the antennae. Isa feels each vibration in her molars. \\u201cYou want an apology.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI want the arithmetic.\\u201d He steps back, gesturing toward the container below with the notebook. \\u201cTwo children for thirty-seven civilians. Your mother always said medicine was about balance.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro turns then, slowly, palms open. Snow dusts her eyelashes like ash. \\u201cThey\\u2019re your nieces, Varga. Luna has your sister\\u2019s eyes.\\u201d\\n\\nThe pistol wavers for the first time. \\u201cMy sister bled out on Route 17 because your convoy didn\\u2019t stop. Don\\u2019t speak to me of eyes.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s hand drifts toward the laptop. The screen saver shifts: blood-red pixels pooling, erasing, pooling again. She imagines the upload as a hemorrhage that cannot be staunched. \\u201cThen why give us the choice?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBecause absolution purchased cheap is indistinguishable from guilt.\\u201d He lays the notebook on the console beside the lever. Ink has bloomed through the pages, turning dates and dosages into bruises. \\u201cYour mother died believing she\\u2019d protected you from this. I\\u2019m correcting the record.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro picks up the log. Her thumb traces a smear that might once have been a signature. \\u201cShe wrote you letters. Every Christmas. They came back marked \\u2018deceased.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cDead men don\\u2019t read.\\u201d Varga\\u2019s laugh is winter wind through pine needles. \\u201cBut they listen. I heard the lullaby you sing to the little one\\u2014\\u2018blood is thicker than water\\u2019\\u2014and I thought, yes, but water drowns just the same.\\u201d\\n\\nA low metallic thud echoes from the container; Luna kicking the wall in Morse code they taught her last summer: H-U-R-T. Caro\\u2019s shoulders jerk as if the bullet has already entered.\\n\\nIsa steps between them. The pistol\\u2019s muzzle fills her vision, black and perfect as a pupil. \\u201cShoot me if you want. The file uploads automatically if my heart stops.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIsa\\u2014\\u201d Caro\\u2019s protest is half-sob.\\n\\nBut Varga lowers the weapon. Snow hisses against the barrel. \\u201cYou still believe sacrifice is noble. Your mother taught you that too.\\u201d He nods toward the glass, where Min\\u2019s small silhouette presses against the frosted pane. \\u201cMake the children watch, or make them free. Either way, you carry it.\\u201d\\n\\nThe emergency strip sputters, then steadies. In its sickly glow the three of them stand like actors caught between scenes, waiting for the next line they already know by heart.\\n\\nCaro closes the notebook and sets it beside the lever. The leather is warm from her grip. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll choose,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut we choose together.\\u201d\\n\\nVarga holsters the pistol. \\u201cThen hurry. Dawn breaks hard on this latitude.\\u201d\\n\\nHe turns his back on them\\u2014an act of trust or contempt\\u2014and starts down the stairs. The notebook stays behind, a mute witness. Through the glass, Luna\\u2019s silhouette lifts a hand: not waving, but reaching.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s fingers find Caro\\u2019s. Their knuckles whiten around the cold metal lever. Somewhere below, a single detonator clicks, arming itself for whatever comes next.\\n\\nWind scours the courtyard, whipping snow into needles. The listening post looms behind them, metal ribs glowing red where embers cling. Blood\\u2014someone\\u2019s blood\\u2014has frozen in rust-black petals across the threshold. Isa\\u2019s breath fogs and snaps away like torn gauze. Caro stands opposite, boots planted, fists balled so tight the knuckles bleach.\\n\\n\\u201cSay it again,\\u201d Caro snarls. \\u201cSay my grandfather was a butcher.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s reply is a shard of ice. \\u201cHe guided the shells. You know it, I know it.\\u201d\\n\\nSnow swallows the echo. The sky above the border is colorless, a lid pressed down on the world. Caro steps forward; crusted snow groans under her weight. \\u201cHe was nineteen. They told him civilians had evacuated. They lied to him the way they lied to us all.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAnd you kept lying.\\u201d Isa\\u2019s voice cracks. \\u201cTwenty-eight years. You buried the report with him so your family\\u2019s name stayed clean.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro flinches, but only once. \\u201cWhat choice did I have? You think Pyongyang differentiates between one Park and the next? Upload that file and my nieces, my cousins, every kid with my blood\\u2014\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2014gets on a watch list.\\u201d Isa spits the words. \\u201cThey\\u2019ll live. The villagers didn\\u2019t.\\u201d\\n\\nThe wind cuts sideways, driving snow against their cheeks like sand. Somewhere inside the container Luna coughs\\u2014a thin sound, almost lost. Caro\\u2019s shoulders twitch toward the door, then lock. \\u201cYou\\u2019re so pure, Mendoza? You signed the same blackout clauses. You stood in that cholera ward and let the North Korean officer dictate who got medicine first. Don\\u2019t lecture me about bodies on the ground.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa feels the accusation strike bone. The night in \\u201996 rushes back: lanterns guttering, the stench of bleach and cordite, Caro\\u2019s grandfather\\u2014barely more than a boy\\u2014translating threats while Isa pressed compresses to a child whose lung hissed air. She had swallowed the order. She had chosen the mission.\\n\\n\\u201cI stayed to save who I could,\\u201d she says.\\n\\n\\u201cYou stayed to save yourself.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s boots crunch closer. \\u201cYour license. Your precious neutrality. You think MSF would\\u2019ve kept you after a massacre scandal? You would\\u2019ve been radioactive.\\u201d\\n\\nSnowflakes catch in Isa\\u2019s lashes, melt, run like tears she refuses to shed. \\u201cAnd you think burying it saved anyone? Look at Luna. Look at Min. The river keeps demanding payment, Caro. It just changes currency.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s laugh is a choked thing. \\u201cThe river? That\\u2019s rich from the woman who let a lullaby be the last thing those kids heard.\\u201d She jerks her chin toward the burning post; inside, the laptop\\u2019s screen still pulses the final line like a heartbeat. Blood is thicker than water, but water washes everything away.\\n\\nIsa steps until they are an arm\\u2019s length apart. Breath mingles, white on white. \\u201cYour grandfather\\u2019s signature is on the artillery map. Not mine.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYour initials are on the redaction.\\u201d Caro\\u2019s finger stabs the air between them. \\u201cPage twelve, paragraph three\\u2014\\u2018civilians observed, numbers indeterminate.\\u2019 Gone because you agreed.\\u201d\\n\\nThe words hang, crystallize. Snow sifts down the collar of Isa\\u2019s coat; it might as well be guilt. She thinks of the children inside, wired to a stranger\\u2019s revenge, and the weight feels unbearable.\\n\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t change what I did,\\u201d she whispers. \\u201cBut I can stop lying now.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s face contorts\\u2014rage, grief, something rawer. \\u201cIf we release that file, they\\u2019ll erase us. All of us. My family becomes ghosts.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThen be ghosts who told the truth.\\u201d Isa\\u2019s voice is quiet enough that only the wind carries it. \\u201cOr stay alive and keep pretending the river never flooded.\\u201d\\n\\nFor a moment neither moves. The snow thickens, erasing boot prints as fast as they form. A timber inside the post cracks, loud as a gunshot. Sparks whirl skyward and die.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s shoulders sag; the fight drains so suddenly she looks deflated. When she speaks again, the anger is gone, replaced by something harder. \\u201cIf we do this, we do it together. All the consequences. No martyrs, no saints.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa nods once. The motion loosens the ice in her hair; it falls like broken glass.\\n\\nBehind them, the container door rattles. Luna\\u2019s voice leaks through the steel, small but steady. \\u201cMom? Auntie Caro? We\\u2019re still here.\\u201d\\n\\nThe women turn. Snow hisses against the burning post, and the lullaby line flickers on the laptop screen one last time before the fire eats the wire.\\n\\nIsa reaches out. Caro\\u2019s gloved hand finds hers. They clasp\\u2014not in forgiveness, not yet, but in the simple animal need to walk into the next second without letting go.\\n\\nThe courtyard stretches ahead, white and unmarked.\\n\\nThe wind howls off the Tumen, knifing through the seams of Isa\\u2019s parka. Her breath comes in ragged, crystalline bursts; every exhale is a small white flag. Beside her, Caro\\u2019s dark hair is rimmed with frost, the strands stiff as wire. They had been shouting\\u2014about blame, about blood, about who first taught whom to run instead of fight\\u2014until the metal between them rang like a bell.\\n\\nThen, through that same metal, a voice:\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re not bargaining chips.\\u201d\\n\\nLuna\\u2019s words shake, but they carry. The wind drops, shocked. Inside the container, Min\\u2019s muffled sob answers like an echo.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s knees buckle before her mind catches up. The snow crunches beneath her weight, sharp crystals biting through the fabric of her trousers. Caro sinks beside her, palms already spread against the wall as if it were skin she could warm. Rust flakes away beneath their touch, revealing colder steel beneath.\\n\\n\\u201cLuna,\\u201d Isa whispers. The name fogs against the metal, a ghost that won\\u2019t stay put.\\n\\n\\u201cMom.\\u201d The reply is smaller now, threaded with static. \\u201cI can\\u2019t feel my toes, but I can hear you breathing. Both of you. You\\u2019re arguing like the river isn\\u2019t right there, waiting.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s breath catches, turns into a cough that tastes of iron. She leans her forehead to the wall. On the other side, inches away, her daughter sits wired to enough explosive to erase last names.\\n\\n\\u201cI used to sing that lullaby to you,\\u201d Caro says, voice raspy. \\u201cThe one about blood and water. I thought if I hummed loud enough, the river would forget its own name.\\u201d\\n\\nA pause. Snow ticks against the corrugated roof like failing Morse code.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the river\\u2019s job to forget,\\u201d Luna answers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s yours.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s shoulders fold inward. Isa reaches\\u2014slow, tentative\\u2014until her gloved fingers brush Caro\\u2019s sleeve. The fabric is stiff with ice, but beneath it she feels the tremor of a heart that has sprinted for twenty-seven years without resting.\\n\\n\\u201cCaro,\\u201d Isa says, quietly enough that only the three of them will ever hear. \\u201cWe kneel now, or we crawl forever.\\u201d\\n\\nSnow begins to fall in heavier flakes, each one a small, cold absolution. They kneel, foreheads to the wall, listening to their children breathe on the other side. Between them, the container\\u2019s shadow blackens the snow like a spill of ink, and inside that shadow lies the bomb that measures choice in grams of pressure.\\n\\nFrom somewhere behind them, the interpreter\\u2019s footsteps retreat\\u2014one pair of boots crunching away across the riverbank, satisfied or merely finished, impossible to tell. The listening post groans in the wind, antennae quivering like tuning forks that will never find the right note.\\n\\nCaro lifts her head first. Her eyes are the color of river ice at dusk, reflecting both sky and depth. \\u201cWhen we open that door,\\u201d she says, \\u201cwe open everything. No more quiet reports in locked drawers. No more pretending the water didn\\u2019t see.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa nods. She can taste blood where she has bitten through the inside of her cheek; the flavor is metallic, familiar, the taste of every secret she has ever swallowed. She presses her palm flat against the wall, imagining the small curve of Luna\\u2019s shoulder on the other side.\\n\\n\\u201cLuna,\\u201d she calls, steady now. \\u201cWe\\u2019re coming in. Tell Min to close her eyes when the doors swing.\\u201d\\n\\nA soft laugh, half sob. \\u201cAlready closed. But I\\u2019ll keep talking. Someone has to remind the dark that it\\u2019s just the absence of light.\\u201d\\n\\nCaro rises first, then Isa. Their boots squeak against the packed snow as they turn. Ahead, the container\\u2019s keypad blinks red beneath a layer of frost. Beyond it, the frozen ribbon of the Tumen waits, carrying moonlight on its back like scattered bones.\\n\\nThey walk the last three paces shoulder to shoulder, not touching, but close enough that the heat between them melts the snow that clings to their sleeves. The bomb\\u2019s timer ticks once more\\u2014a sound too soft for ears, but felt in the marrow\\u2014then stills, as though holding its breath with them.\\n\\nAt the threshold, Caro\\u2019s hand hovers over the lever. Isa covers it with her own. No words now; the wind has taken them all. Together they push down.\\n\\nThe latch clicks. Metal groans. A rush of warm, stale air escapes, carrying the faint scent of iodine and fear. Inside, two small figures blink against the sudden daylight, faces streaked with tears that freeze faster than they fall.\\n\\nBehind them, the first tongue of flame licks up the listening post\\u2019s eastern wall, turning the rust into a bright, brief flower. Smoke coils skyward, erasing every last syllable of the lullaby.\\n\\nCaro steps across the threshold. Isa follows. They do not look back at the fire; they look only at their daughters, at two pairs of eyes reflecting the same river that has carried every secret they ever tried to bury.\\n\\nSnow keeps falling, soft as apology. The sisters lift the children into their arms. When they step outside again, the world is already different\\u2014no longer a ledger of sins and silences, but something wetter, more fluid, something that moves toward the sea whether they wish it or not.\\n\\nThe control room smells of hot circuitry and old fear. A single fluorescent tube stutters overhead, painting the lever in sickly pulses of white. Isa\\u2019s palm hovers an inch above the worn plastic; the edges are scratched, as if every previous choice had clawed at it.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s fingers slide over Isa\\u2019s\\u2014warm, steady, the pulse in her wrist hammering like a trapped sparrow. Their knuckles touch, skin chafing from the cold outside. No words now; the room is too small for speeches. Isa feels the tremor travel from Caro into her own bones until the lever itself seems to breathe.\\n\\nThe kidnapper\\u2019s voice drifts back from the corridor, a murmured stanza of the lullaby, thin as smoke. \\u201c\\ud53c\\ub294 \\ubb3c\\ubcf4\\ub2e4 \\uc9c4\\ud558\\ub2e4\\u2026\\u201d Blood is thicker than water. The rest hangs unspoken.\\n\\nIsa\\u2019s throat tastes of iron. Luna\\u2019s earlier whisper\\u2014Do what you couldn\\u2019t do before\\u2014echoes behind her ribs louder than any explosion. She thinks of the 1996 report: the blacked-out names, the signatures her mother forged, the villages quietly erased from maps. She thinks of Luna and Min wired to a plate no bigger than a cafeteria tray.\\n\\nCaro presses down first. The lever gives a millimeter with a reluctant click, as though it, too, has a conscience. Isa adds her weight. The mechanism sinks the rest of the way.\\n\\nA soft pneumatic hiss\\u2014unexpectedly gentle. Not the roar of detonation but the sigh of a secret exhaled. The laptop screen flickers: UPLOAD 100%. Then the countdown on the pressure plate freezes at 00:00:02 and winks out, letters dissolving into black.\\n\\nFor a moment no one moves. Isa\\u2019s heartbeat is the loudest thing in the universe. Then the magnetic locks on the container doors clunk open, the sound traveling through the metal like a tolling bell.\\n\\nThey run. Boots skid on frost-slick linoleum, past the gutted radio racks and dangling fiber-optic veins. The corridor tilts downward; every footfall lands heavier than the last. Isa reaches the container first and grips the handle, cold enough to scald. She hauls. The hinges scream, and daylight knifes in\\u2014steel-gray dawn, river-smell of snow and rust.\\n\\nInside, Luna and Min sit back-to-back on the bomb crate, wrists zip-tied, silver tape across their mouths. Min\\u2019s glasses are cracked but intact; Luna\\u2019s eyes are huge, reflecting the burning sky behind them. The pressure plate between their sneakers is dark, harmless, a plastic square of surrendered power.\\n\\nIsa drops to her knees. The tape comes off Luna\\u2019s mouth in one rip; the sound is sharper than the bomb would have been. Luna\\u2019s first breath is half-sob, half-laugh. \\u201cTook you long enough,\\u201d she whispers, then burrows her face into Isa\\u2019s shoulder.\\n\\nCaro saws through Min\\u2019s restraints with a multitool blade that shakes only slightly. When the last cuff parts, Min lunges forward, arms around Caro\\u2019s neck, a muffled \\u201ceonni\\u201d muffled against Caro\\u2019s parka. Caro holds him so tightly her own tears freeze on his hair.\\n\\nBehind them, the listening post groans. A tongue of orange fire licks out of the control-room doorway\\u2014transformers popping like distant gunshots. The lullaby that played on a loop is now only crackling vinyl and melting circuitry.\\n\\nIsa rises, Luna clinging to her side, and steps out onto the snow. The river waits below, a gray ribbon frozen to silence. Footprints already mar the surface\\u2014escape routes drawn by moonlight and panic. She and Caro exchange a glance: no more hiding behind neutrality, no more erasures.\\n\\nTogether they lift the children. Luna\\u2019s weight is slight but real; Min\\u2019s heavier, trusting. Their boots crunch across the frost. Smoke billows overhead, carrying the last syllables of the lullaby into the low clouds. Ash drifts like dark snow.\\n\\nAt the riverbank, Isa hesitates. The ice creaks, uncertain. Caro nudges her. \\u201cWe go together,\\u201d she says, voice hoarse. \\u201cSame weight, same risk.\\u201d\\n\\nThey step onto the Tumen. The river accepts them without a sound, carrying their reflections\\u2014four figures stitched by dawnlight\\u2014across the border that was never more than a line someone drew on thawing water.\\n\\nBehind, the listening post collapses in on itself, a final cough of sparks. Ahead, the far bank waits, blank and unwritten.\\n\\nThe river groaned like old iron under their weight. Each footstep cracked the glaze of ice, sending spider-veins racing ahead of them. Isa\\u2019s boots slipped first; Caro\\u2019s shoulder steadied her before she went down with Luna on her back. The six-year-old\\u2019s arms were locked so tight around Isa\\u2019s neck that every breath tasted of the child\\u2019s fear\\u2014metallic, like pennies held too long in the mouth.\\n\\nBehind them, the listening post roared awake. A single tongue of orange licked up the eastern wall, catching the dry antennae, turning the dead trees into sudden torches. The heat reached them across forty yards of wind, enough to warm the backs of their necks. Luna lifted her head.\\n\\n\\u201cMama\\u2019s humming stopped,\\u201d she whispered.\\n\\nIsa hadn\\u2019t realized the lullaby had been playing from the shack\\u2019s tin speaker until the moment it died. Now only the wind stayed, scraping across the flats like a bow across rusted strings.\\n\\nCaro adjusted Min on her hip. The boy\\u2019s cheek was swollen where tape had torn free; his eyes were wide, reflecting the inferno they\\u2019d left. \\u201cKeep them forward,\\u201d she told Isa, voice smoke-rough. \\u201cDon\\u2019t look back.\\u201d\\n\\nBut Isa did. She watched the roof cave inward, sparks spiraling up into the iron dawn. In the fire\\u2019s bright throat she saw the laptop, screen cracked like an eye, the two phantom buttons now molten plastic. Somewhere in the collapsing roof, the last copy of the 1996 report\\u2014her mother\\u2019s careful omissions, Caro\\u2019s grandfather\\u2019s signature\\u2014crackled into ash. Yet the internet had already inhaled it; she imagined servers humming in Seoul, Geneva, Pyongyang, mirrors multiplying faster than censors could blink.\\n\\nA boom rolled across the water, deep as war drums. The concussion shoved them forward. Ice buckled ahead, a dark seam opening. Caro didn\\u2019t hesitate; she stepped onto the floating slab and kept walking, Min\\u2019s legs clamped around her waist like a small, stubborn koala. Isa followed, Luna\\u2019s weight settling heavier with each yard, the child\\u2019s breaths shallow but steady.\\n\\nMidstream, the river narrowed to the width of a two-lane road. Across the far bank, the Russian side waited: birch trunks ghost-white against the gray sky, nothing else. No border guards, no flashing lights. Just silence and the morning that refused to bloom.\\n\\nLuna stirred. \\u201cI can walk.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa knelt; the ice kissed her knees through the ripped fabric. Luna slid down, fingers still hooked in Isa\\u2019s sleeve. Min wriggled free of Caro and took his cousin\\u2019s hand. Two small figures in borrowed coats, stamping to keep blood moving.\\n\\nCaro\\u2019s breath fogged between them. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll need to move fast once we hit the trees. They\\u2019ll send drones.\\u201d\\n\\nIsa nodded, but her legs felt packed with sand. She looked at the fire again. The shack was a black rib cage now, beams glowing like coals in a forge. The lullaby was truly gone; only the wind carried its last note, stretched until it snapped.\\n\\nCaro touched Isa\\u2019s elbow. \\u201cWe chose right.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWe chose,\\u201d Isa echoed. The distinction felt important.\\n\\nTogether they started up the far bank, boots breaking through crusted snow. Behind them the river kept sliding east, carrying chips of burning wood and a curl of melody no one would ever catch. Ahead, the birch trunks parted like theater curtains on a stage still empty.\\n\\nLuna began to hum\\u2014not the lullaby, but something brighter, half-forgotten from a playground long ago. Min joined on the off-beat. Their small voices braided in the cold air, a new thread to follow.\\n\\nIsa and Caro walked behind them, shoulder to shoulder now, no one leading, no one following. The fire\\u2019s glow faded against their backs; the children\\u2019s silhouettes sharpened in the rising light. When they reached the first tree line, the sky cracked open a seam of pale silver, and the river behind them kept rolling, indifferent, carrying the last of their secrets out to sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\nConcatenate Chapters: Combine the content of all chapters in the correct order.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Headings: Ensure each chapter begins with a level 1 heading (#) indicating the chapter title (e.g., # Chapter 1: The Beginning).\\n\\nConsistent Formatting: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document (e.g., paragraph spacing, indentation).\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput: Return the complete book manuscript in Markdown format.
