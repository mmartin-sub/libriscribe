Isa is mid-air in a Médecins Sans Frontières helicopter evacuating a pregnant teenager from Mosul to Ramstein when a surface-to-air missile clips the tail rotor; the chopper spins into the Black Forest. Simultaneously, in Seoul, Caro’s nine-year-old son Min is pulled off a jam-packed subway by silent men in surgical masks. At 14:37 exactly, both women receive the same encrypted video: Luna and Min bound, blindfolded, and breathing through straws inside a freight container. A distorted voice recites the first line of their childhood lullaby—“Dors, mon trésor, 자장가를 불러”—then demands they return to the river where they buried the truth. Isa crawls from the burning wreckage with a dislocated shoulder and a concussion; Caro drops a tray of orchids in a Gangnam penthouse, her perfectly manicured world cracking like porcelain. Both realize the distance they cultivated was never geographic at all.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Park Caro meticulously arranges orchids in her Gangnam penthouse while her son Min practices K-pop dance moves on a tablet, ignoring her reminders about subway safety.\\n- Characters: Park Caro, Min\\n- Setting: Sleek Gangnam penthouse, Seoul, South Korea\\n- Goal: Contrast Caro’s controlled, affluent life with the impending chaos, highlighting her emotional distance from Min.\\n- Emotional Beat: Fractured calm beneath curated perfection.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling.
