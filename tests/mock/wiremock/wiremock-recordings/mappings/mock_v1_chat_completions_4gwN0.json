The stroke that fells their mother erases twenty years of silence overnight, forcing Isa—an ICU nurse in Strasbourg—and Caro—a diplomat’s wife in Seoul—to confront the resentments that have calcified between them. Traveling by slow trains, night ferries, and a border the internet says is closed, each sister drags a reluctant child and an even heavier past. What begins as a frantic scavenger hunt becomes a raw, argumentative reunion on the banks of the Rhine, where the tracks that once connected Europe were torn up in 1962. By moonset, the sisters discover that the map was never about geography—it was a final lesson in how love can reroute itself when everything else is broken.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: The decommissioned station on the Rhine—its tracks rusted since 1962—materializes out of fog exactly where the overlapped halves predict. Isa arrives first, Lila filming the blood-red moonrise on her cracked phone. Caro and Min sprint from the opposite embankment, ferry salt still crusting their hair. The reunion is not cinematic; it’s a collision of exhaustion, relief, and twenty years of unsaid things. Border police floodlights pin them in place, demanding transit papers neither woman possesses. In the chaos, Min drops the composite map; the wind scatters the pages across the tracks like white moths. Lila, laughing and crying, grabs her cousin’s hand and drags both families onto the center line where the old rails once met. Under the copper moon, Isa admits she envied Caro’s escape; Caro confesses she was terrified of becoming their mother—brilliant, rootless, alone. The officers, recognizing the desperation of daughters, retreat into the dark. The sisters pick up the scattered pages and realize the route continues past the terminus, looping back toward Alsace. Their mother’s final note, hidden in the spine of the atlas, reads: The map ends where you begin again. Together, they walk the disused track toward the first village light, four silhouettes now, rewriting the rest of the journey in real time.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 7 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 7 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}]}",
