The upload is the complete 1996 Red Cross report, implicating Isa in suppressing evidence of a civilian massacre to protect MSF neutrality, and naming Caro\\u2019s grandfather as a collaborator with North Korean units. If released, Pyongyang will blacklist every Park descendant; Interpol will revoke Isa\\u2019s medical license. The kidnapper steps from the shadows: their mother\\u2019s former interpreter, left for dead in 1996, now seeking poetic justice. Isa and Caro argue in the snow, voices hoarse, until Luna whispers through the container wall: \\u201cWe\\u2019re not bargaining chips.

The report goes public as they carry the children across the frozen Tumen River. Behind them, the listening post burns, taking the lullaby with it. They walk forward, not as saviors or sinners, but as sisters who finally let the river carry their secrets out to sea.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Isa and Caro arrive at the derelict Soviet listening post, the Tumen River glinting under a harsh dawn.
