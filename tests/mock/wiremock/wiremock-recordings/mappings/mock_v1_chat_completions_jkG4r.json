The stroke that fells their mother erases twenty years of silence overnight, forcing Isa—an ICU nurse in Strasbourg—and Caro—a diplomat’s wife in Seoul—to confront the resentments that have calcified between them. Traveling by slow trains, night ferries, and a border the internet says is closed, each sister drags a reluctant child and an even heavier past. What begins as a frantic scavenger hunt becomes a raw, argumentative reunion on the banks of the Rhine, where the tracks that once connected Europe were torn up in 1962. By moonset, the sisters discover that the map was never about geography—it was a final lesson in how love can reroute itself when everything else is broken.\\n\\nThe book requires the following number of main characters: 8\\n\\nFor EACH character, include the following in the profile (return as a JSON array of character objects):\\n\\nName: (Suggest a suitable name appropriate for the language and cultural context of the book)\\n\\nAge:\\n\\nPhysical Description: (Detailed, including appearance, clothing style, etc.)\\n\\nPersonality Traits: (Provide at least 3-5 distinct personality traits as a comma-separated string, for example: \\\"Brave, Loyal, Impulsive, Intelligent, Compassionate\\\")\\n\\nBackground/Backstory: (Detailed, explaining their past and how it shapes them)\\n\\nMotivations: (What drives them?
