A single video shows the kids bound in a freight container, a seven-day countdown ticking beneath bilingual fragments of that lullaby. To save them, Isa and Caro must trace the 37th parallel east across Europe and Asia, solving cryptic clues that resurrect every buried betrayal between them. With the help of a guilt-ridden German pilot and a K-pop logistics prodigy, they race through the Rhine, Neckar, Danube, and the steppes to Vladivostok, guided by their own daughters hacking the chase from inside the container. At the final coordinate—a derelict Soviet listening post on the Russian-Korean border—they face an impossible lever: expose a wartime atrocity that will destroy their reputations and families, or lose the children forever. In the end, the question is not how far they will travel, but how much of themselves they are willing to surrender to the river of secrets that once divided them.\\n\\nThe book requires the following number of main characters: 8\\n\\nFor EACH character, include the following in the profile (return as a JSON array of character objects):\\n\\nName: (Suggest a suitable name appropriate for the language and cultural context of the book)\\n\\nAge:\\n\\nPhysical Description: (Detailed, including appearance, clothing style, etc.)\\n\\nPersonality Traits: (Provide at least 3-5 distinct personality traits as a comma-separated string, for example: \\\"Brave, Loyal, Impulsive, Intelligent, Compassionate\\\")\\n\\nBackground/Backstory: (Detailed, explaining their past and how it shapes them)\\n\\nMotivations: (What drives them?
