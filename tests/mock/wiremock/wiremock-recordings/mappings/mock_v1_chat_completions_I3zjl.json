Birth-country, career, and continents have split them since their double wedding, yet the ache of separation runs deeper than miles. When Isa\\\\u2019s helicopter crashes in the Black Forest and Caro\\\\u2019s son vanishes from a Seoul subway platform on the same day, the sisters receive an identical, cryptic text: \\\\u201cThe star that binds you also breaks you. Meet where time cradles the river.\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\nWith their daughters as unlikely companions\\\\u2014Isa\\\\u2019s fearless eleven-year-old Luna and Caro\\\\u2019s tech-savvy nine-year-old Hana\\\\u2014the mothers begin converging journeys. From triage tents to neon-lit arcades, from Rhine barges to bullet trains, they chase clues encoded in childhood lullabies and half-remembered dreams. Each mile strips away old resentments: Isa\\\\u2019s guilt over abandoning family for duty, Caro\\\\u2019s quiet fury at being left behind. Their path arcs along the 37th meridian, a scar across the globe that mirrors the scar tissue in their hearts. At the nexus point where the Rhine meets the Neckar, under the shadow of an ancient bridge, the sisters must decide whether reunion is merely an arrival\\\\u2014or an act of creation.\\\"}\\n        ```\\n        The book should be written in US-English.\\n\\n        Evaluate:\\n        - Strengths and weaknesses\\n        - Market potential\\n        - Originality\\n        - Clarity and coherence\\n\\n        IMPORTANT: Write your critique entirely in US-English.\\n        Start your response directly with the critique content.
