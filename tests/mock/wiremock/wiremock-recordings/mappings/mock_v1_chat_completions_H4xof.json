Klaus and Ji-eun broker an uneasy truce: one plane, one mission. The next clue—coordinates 49.4875° N, 8.4669° E—point to the Rhine at Mannheim, where they once scattered their mother’s ashes. There, wedged in the bridge’s lattice, they find a waterproof capsule containing a flash drive and a second lullaby fragment in Korean hanja. Luna, speaking through a dark-web voice scrambler, guides them: the drive holds a fragment of a 1996 Red Cross report on a massacre their mother witnessed. Each new coordinate forces them to confront old wounds: Isa’s forged medical exemption that let her dodge Korean conscription while Caro’s brother served and died; Caro’s refusal to forgive Isa for dismissing han as “self-indulgent grief.” Between checkpoints—Neckar River, Danube at Linz, across the Ukrainian steppes—the sisters translate the lullaby line by line, realizing the kidnapper knows every syllable of their shared past. Hana, Caro’s daughter, hacks into Russian rail cams to confirm the freight container is moving east on the Trans-Siberian line, destination Vladivostok.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Inside a cramped hangar, Klaus and Ji-eun present a map tracing the 37th parallel, revealing the first destination: the Rhine River in Mannheim. Isa and Caro argue over past betrayals, but Ji-eun interrupts with a cryptic lullaby fragment, forcing them to prioritize action.\\n- Characters: Isa, Caro, Klaus, Ji-eun\\n- Setting: Airport hangar, Frankfurt-Hahn\\n- Goal: Define the mission’s structure and the sisters’ conflicting motivations.\\n- Emotional Beat: Reluctant cooperation and simmering guilt\\n\\nInstructions:\\n- Write a vivid, engaging scene that captures these elements.\\n- Include descriptive details and sensory information about the setting.\\n- Show character emotions and development through actions and dialogue.\\n- Advance the story according to the scene's goal and emotional beat.\\n- Make the scene flow naturally and avoid unnecessary exposition.\\n- Ensure the scene ends in a way that connects smoothly to the next scene.\\n- Use language and style appropriate for the genre.\\n\\nImportant: Focus on showing rather than telling. Create an immersive experience that brings the scene to life.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The content should be written entirely in US-English.\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Begin the scene with the title: ## Scene 2: Inside a cramped hangar, Klaus and Ji-eun present a map tracing the 37th parallel, revealing the first destination: the Rhine River in Mannheim.
