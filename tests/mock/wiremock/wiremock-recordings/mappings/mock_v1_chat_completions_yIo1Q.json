The stroke, the nurse says; come quickly. Twelve minutes earlier, Caro Han stands in her darkened high-rise kitchen, watching the Han River disappear into fog, when the same call reaches her. Both open identical battered envelopes: half of their mother’s hand-drawn atlas, a red circle labeled “Eclipse Terminus,” and a sticky note—You have until the moon turns. Isa packs an overnight bag, drafts a forged doctor’s note, and bribes her fearless seventeen-year-old daughter, Lila, with the promise of authentic Korean fried chicken. Caro stuffs her passport with diplomatic pouches, promises her anxious ten-year-old son, Min, that missing a week of school will become “a family legend,” and trades homemade kimchi for a conductor’s blind eye. By dawn, both women are on opposite platforms, clutching half a map and the same impossible deadline.\\n\\nScene Details:\\n- Summary: Caro Han, standing in her fog-shrouded Seoul kitchen, receives the same call about her mother’s stroke.
