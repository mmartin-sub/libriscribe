Simplify magic: Keep the map’s impossible routes; drop the “passable only by the brave” flourish—let the bravery be emotional, not supernatural.  \\n2. Anchor guilt in sensory specifics: Isa’s sterile night-lit hospital hallway; Caro’s silent Seoul apartment at 3 a.m.—show, don’t catalog.  \\n3. Tighten clock: Instead of “meridian moon,” use one astronomical event (e.g., lunar eclipse visible on both continents) to unify the countdown.  \\n4. Re-title something visceral—“Half a Map, Half a World,” “Time Zone Love,” or “The Last Crossing”—while retaining meridian imagery if desired.  \\n5. Early chapter outline: Parallel prologues—one child asleep on a Strasbourg-bound train, the other on a Seoul platform—then smash-cut to the stroke and the map in chapter one.\\n\\n        The book should be written in US-English.\\n\\n        Return a refined JSON object within a Markdown code block with the same structure as the original.\"}]}",
