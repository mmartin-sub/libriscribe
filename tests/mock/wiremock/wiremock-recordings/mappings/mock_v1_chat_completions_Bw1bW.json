The stroke that fells their mother erases twenty years of silence overnight, forcing Isa—an ICU nurse in Strasbourg—and Caro—a diplomat’s wife in Seoul—to confront the resentments that have calcified between them. Traveling by slow trains, night ferries, and a border the internet says is closed, each sister drags a reluctant child and an even heavier past. What begins as a frantic scavenger hunt becomes a raw, argumentative reunion on the banks of the Rhine, where the tracks that once connected Europe were torn up in 1962. By moonset, the sisters discover that the map was never about geography—it was a final lesson in how love can reroute itself when everything else is broken.\\n\\n            Chapter Summary: At 3:07 a.m. in Strasbourg’s ICU, Isa Moreau is resuscitating a seizing teenager when her phone buzzes with a Seoul number. The stroke, the nurse says; come quickly. Twelve minutes earlier, Caro Han stands in her darkened high-rise kitchen, watching the Han River disappear into fog, when the same call reaches her. Both open identical battered envelopes: half of their mother’s hand-drawn atlas, a red circle labeled “Eclipse Terminus,” and a sticky note—You have until the moon turns. Isa packs an overnight bag, drafts a forged doctor’s note, and bribes her fearless seventeen-year-old daughter, Lila, with the promise of authentic Korean fried chicken. Caro stuffs her passport with diplomatic pouches, promises her anxious ten-year-old son, Min, that missing a week of school will become “a family legend,” and trades homemade kimchi for a conductor’s blind eye. By dawn, both women are on opposite platforms, clutching half a map and the same impossible deadline.\\n\\n            The outline should include a breakdown of EXACTLY 5 scenes for this chapter, with EACH scene having:\\n            * Scene Number: (e.g., Scene 1, Scene 2, etc.)\\n            * Summary: (A short description of what happens in the scene, 1-2 sentences)\\n            * Characters: (A list of the characters involved, separated by commas)\\n            * Setting: (Where the scene takes place)\\n            * Goal: (The purpose of the scene)\\n            * Emotional Beat: (The primary emotion conveyed in the scene)\\n\\n            IMPORTANT: Format the scene outline using Markdown bullet points, as shown below:\\n\\n            Scene 1:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            Scene 2:\\n                * Summary: [Scene summary here]\\n                * Characters: [Character 1, Character 2, ...]\\n                * Setting: [Scene setting]\\n                * Goal: [Scene goal]\\n                * Emotional Beat: [Scene emotional beat]\\n\\n            [Repeat for exactly 5 scenes, maintaining the exact same bullet point format]\\n\\n            Be sure to include all main characters relevant to this chapter and create a natural flow between scenes.\\n            \"}]}",
