They have not spoken since their joint wedding dissolved in competing vows: one to the Hippocratic oath, the other to filial duty. The sisters have convinced themselves the distance is purely geographic.\\n\\nThat illusion shatters at 14:37 on a Tuesday. Isa\\u2019s med-evac is shot down over the Black Forest; Caro\\u2019s son is yanked from a Seoul subway at the exact same minute. A video arrives on both their phones: the children bound and blindfolded inside a freight container, coordinates ticking down seven days. The kidnapper signs off with one line of their childhood lullaby\\u2014French and Korean in a single breath\\u2014and a demand: \\u201cRevisit the river where you buried the truth.\\u201d\\n\\nTo secure international transit in hours, not days, the sisters accept clandestine help: a shell-shocked German pilot who owes Isa his life and Caro\\u2019s ex-roommate, now a K-pop tour logistics wizard. The chase runs along the 37th parallel east\\u2014Rhine, Neckar, Danube, across the steppes to Vladivostok\\u2014each checkpoint revealed by solving bilingual fragments of the lullaby they once sang together. Luna, Isa\\u2019s eleven-year-old, guides them through dark-web maps; Hana, Caro\\u2019s nine-year-old coding prodigy, feeds them real-time CCTV hacks from inside the container.\\n\\nOld resentments surface in hard specifics: Isa\\u2019s guilt over dodging Korean conscription law that punished Caro\\u2019s brother; Caro\\u2019s fury at Isa\\u2019s casual dismissal of han\\u2014Korean grief that never ends. Yet the same cultural chords that divide them become the code that keeps their children alive.\\n\\nAt the final coordinate\\u2014an abandoned Soviet listening post on the Russian-Korean border\\u2014the sisters face a literal switch: release the children by uploading a classified wartime atrocity report that will ruin Isa\\u2019s reputation and put Caro\\u2019s entire family on a Pyongyang watch-list. Or walk away with their names intact and never see the kids again. The choice is no longer metaphor but a cold, mechanical lever.\\n\\nOnly one question remains: is blood thicker than the river of secrets they once poured it into?\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Format your response EXACTLY as shown below, with consistent header formatting and numbering:\\nIf there's a book length: (high), adjust the number of chapters accordingly.\\n\\n# Book Summary\\n[Write a brief summary of the entire book here, 2-3 paragraphs]\\n\\n# Chapter List\\n[Total number of chapters, definitively stated.
