- Maintained consistency with existing documentation structure

## Code Quality Improvements

The recent diff shows a type annotation improvement:
```python
# Before
def __init__(self):

# After
def __init__(self) -> None:
```

This aligns with the project's commitment to comprehensive type annotations and Python 3.12 best practices.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Performance Monitoring
```python
monitor = AsyncPerformanceMonitor()
result = await monitor.monitor_operation("operation_name", async_function)
summary = monitor.get_performance_summary()
```

### Parallel Task Execution
```python
task_manager = AsyncTaskManager()
results = await task_manager.execute_parallel_tasks(tasks, max_concurrent=5)
```

### Memory Profiling
```python
profiler = MemoryProfiler()
profiler.take_snapshot("start")
# ... operations ...
profiler.take_snapshot("end")
summary = profiler.get_memory_summary()
```

### Caching
```python
cache = AgentCache()
cache.set("key", value)
cached_value = cache.get("key")
stats = cache.get_cache_stats()
```

## Best Practices Documented

1. **Use Async Operations**: Prefer async methods for I/O operations
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use performance monitoring for critical operations
3. **Manage Memory**: Take memory snapshots for memory-intensive operations
4. **Cache Results**: Use caching for expensive computations
5. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple items together when possible
6. **Handle Errors**: Use retry mechanisms for unreliable operations
