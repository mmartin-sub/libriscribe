# Introduction to LibriScribe

LibriScribe is an AI-powered book writing assistant designed to streamline the creative process. It uses a multi-agent architecture, with each agent specialized in a particular task. This introduction provides an overview of the project and its capabilities.

## Core Concepts

LibriScribe is built around the idea of a **multi-agent system**.  Each agent is a Python class responsible for a specific aspect of the book writing process.  This modular design makes the project extensible and easier to maintain.

## Agents

Here's a brief overview of the key agents:

*   **`ProjectManagerAgent`:**  Manages the overall workflow and coordinates the other agents.  This is the main interface for the command-line tool.
*   **`ConceptGeneratorAgent`:**  Generates initial book concepts, including title, logline, and a detailed description.
*   **`OutlinerAgent`:**  Creates a comprehensive chapter-by-chapter outline for the book.
*   **`CharacterGeneratorAgent`:**  Generates detailed character profiles, including background, personality, and relationships.
*   **`WorldbuildingAgent`:**  Creates detailed worldbuilding information (history, culture, geography, etc.) relevant to the book's genre and setting.
*   **`ChapterWriterAgent`:**  Writes the first draft of a chapter based on the outline, character profiles, and worldbuilding details.
*   **`EditorAgent`:**  Refines and edits a chapter, focusing on clarity, consistency, grammar, and style.
*   **`StyleEditorAgent`:** Refines the chapter's writing style based on specified tone and target audience preferences.
*   **`ContentReviewerAgent`:** Reviews chapter content for consistency, clarity, and plot holes.
*   **`FactCheckerAgent`:**  (Primarily for non-fiction) Verifies factual claims made within a chapter.
*   **`PlagiarismCheckerAgent`:**  Identifies potential plagiarism issues in a chapter.
*   **`ResearcherAgent`:**  Conducts web research on a specified topic and provides a summary of findings.
*   **`FormattingAgent`:**  Combines all generated chapters into a single, well-formatted Markdown or PDF document.
